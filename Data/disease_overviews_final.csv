Disease,Overview
Disease,Overview
Hypertensive Disease,"Hypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure, is a chronic medical condition where the blood pressure in the arteries remains persistently elevated. This condition forces the heart to work harder than normal to circulate blood through the blood vessels. Over time, uncontrolled high blood pressure can lead to serious health complications including heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, and vision problems. Many people with hypertension experience no symptoms, which is why it's often called the 'silent killer.' When symptoms do occur, they may include headaches, shortness of breath, or nosebleeds. Risk factors include obesity, excessive salt intake, alcohol overuse, stress, and family history. Regular blood pressure monitoring is essential for early detection and management."
Diabetes,"Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose over a prolonged period. This condition occurs either when the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin (Type 1 diabetes) or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces (Type 2 diabetes). Common symptoms include increased thirst, frequent urination, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and blurred vision. If left untreated, diabetes can lead to serious complications such as cardiovascular disease, nerve damage, kidney failure, and vision loss. Management typically involves blood sugar monitoring, dietary modifications, regular physical activity, and often medication or insulin therapy. People with diabetes need to be particularly careful about foot care and regular health check-ups."
Depressive Disorder,"Major depressive disorder is a serious mental health condition characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities. These symptoms must last for at least two weeks and represent a change from previous functioning to qualify as clinical depression. Other symptoms may include changes in appetite or weight, sleep disturbances, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and sometimes thoughts of death or suicide. Depression can be triggered by genetic factors, biochemical imbalances, stressful life events, or medical conditions. Treatment typically involves psychotherapy, antidepressant medications, or a combination of both. Without proper treatment, depression can significantly impair a person's ability to function in daily life and maintain relationships."
Coronary Heart Disease,"Coronary artery disease develops when the major blood vessels that supply the heart with blood, oxygen and nutrients become damaged or diseased. This is usually due to the buildup of cholesterol-containing deposits (plaques) on the artery walls, a process called atherosclerosis. As these plaques grow, they can narrow the coronary arteries, decreasing blood flow to the heart. The reduced blood flow may eventually cause chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, or other symptoms. A complete blockage can cause a heart attack. Risk factors include smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and a sedentary lifestyle. Treatment focuses on lifestyle changes, medications, and sometimes surgical procedures to restore adequate blood flow."
Pneumonia,"Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs, which may fill with fluid or pus. This condition can be caused by various organisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Common symptoms include cough with phlegm, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. The severity of pneumonia can range from mild to life-threatening, particularly in infants, young children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems. Bacterial pneumonia, the most common type, is typically treated with antibiotics. Viral pneumonia often improves with rest and home care. Prevention methods include vaccination (such as the pneumococcal vaccine), proper hand hygiene, and avoiding smoking. Hospitalization may be required for severe cases."
Congestive Heart Failure,"Congestive heart failure occurs when the heart muscle doesn't pump blood as well as it should. This condition develops when the heart becomes too weak or stiff to fill and pump efficiently. Blood and fluid can back up into the lungs (causing shortness of breath) and into the legs (causing swelling). Other symptoms may include fatigue, rapid or irregular heartbeat, and persistent cough or wheezing. There are two main types: systolic heart failure (when the heart can't pump forcefully enough) and diastolic heart failure (when the heart can't relax properly to fill with blood). While the condition is serious and chronic, treatments including medications, lifestyle changes, and sometimes devices or surgery can help improve symptoms and prolong life."
Cerebrovascular Accident,"A cerebrovascular accident, commonly called a stroke, occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is interrupted or reduced, preventing brain tissue from getting oxygen and nutrients. There are two main types: ischemic stroke (caused by a blocked artery) and hemorrhagic stroke (caused by a leaking or burst blood vessel). Symptoms appear suddenly and may include trouble speaking or understanding speech, paralysis or numbness of the face, arm or leg (typically on one side), vision problems, severe headache, and difficulty walking. Strokes are medical emergencies that require immediate treatment to minimize brain damage and potential complications. Risk factors include high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, and heart disease. Recovery often involves rehabilitation therapy."
Asthma,"Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that causes recurring episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing, particularly at night or early in the morning. During an asthma attack, the airways become inflamed and narrowed due to muscle tightening and increased mucus production, making breathing difficult. Triggers vary by individual but may include allergens (like pollen or pet dander), respiratory infections, physical activity, cold air, air pollutants, and stress. While there's no cure, asthma can be effectively managed with controller medications (usually inhaled corticosteroids) to reduce inflammation and quick-relief inhalers for symptom flare-ups. Severe attacks may require emergency treatment."
Myocardial Infarction,"A myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow to part of the heart muscle is blocked for a long enough time that part of the heart muscle is damaged or dies. This is usually caused by a blood clot forming on a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque in a coronary artery. Classic symptoms include chest pain or discomfort that may radiate to the shoulder, arm, back, neck or jaw, often described as pressure, squeezing, or fullness. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, lightheadedness, or cold sweats. Women may experience less typical symptoms. Immediate medical attention is crucial to restore blood flow and minimize heart damage. Treatment may include medications, angioplasty with stenting, or coronary artery bypass surgery. Lifestyle changes and medications are needed after a heart attack to prevent future events."
Hypercholesterolemia,"Hypercholesterolemia refers to high levels of cholesterol in the blood, particularly low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or 'bad' cholesterol. This condition significantly increases the risk of developing atherosclerosis (narrowing and hardening of arteries) and subsequent cardiovascular diseases like coronary artery disease and stroke. While some cholesterol is essential for cell function, excess LDL cholesterol can build up in artery walls. The condition often has no symptoms until significant artery damage has occurred. Causes include poor diet (high in saturated and trans fats), lack of exercise, obesity, genetic factors (familial hypercholesterolemia), and certain medical conditions. Treatment focuses on lifestyle modifications (diet, exercise) and often cholesterol-lowering medications like statins. Regular cholesterol screening is important for early detection and management."
Infection,"An infection occurs when harmful microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites invade the body and begin to multiply, often causing illness. Infections can affect any part of the body and range from mild to life-threatening. Common symptoms include fever, fatigue, pain or discomfort in the affected area, swelling, redness, and sometimes pus formation. The body's immune system typically fights off infections, but some require medical treatment with antibiotics (for bacterial infections), antivirals, antifungals, or other medications. Prevention strategies include vaccination, proper hand hygiene, safe food handling, and avoiding contact with infected individuals. Serious infections can lead to sepsis, a life-threatening response to infection that requires immediate medical attention. The risk of infection is higher in people with weakened immune systems."
Urinary Tract Infection,"A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection that can occur in any part of the urinary system, including the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. Most infections involve the lower urinary tract (the bladder and urethra). Women are at greater risk due to their shorter urethra. Symptoms often include a strong, persistent urge to urinate, a burning sensation during urination, passing frequent small amounts of urine, cloudy or strong-smelling urine, and pelvic pain (in women). Kidney infections may cause back pain, high fever, and nausea. UTIs are typically caused by bacteria, especially E. coli, and are treated with antibiotics. Drinking plenty of fluids, urinating after sexual intercourse, and proper hygiene can help prevent UTIs. Recurrent infections may require further medical evaluation."
Anemia,"Anemia is a condition characterized by a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood, resulting in reduced oxygen-carrying capacity. This leads to symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, pale skin, shortness of breath, dizziness, and cold hands and feet. There are several types of anemia, including iron deficiency anemia (most common), vitamin deficiency anemia (B12 or folate), anemia of chronic disease, and aplastic anemia. Causes vary but may include blood loss, poor diet, chronic illnesses, or genetic factors. Diagnosis involves blood tests to measure red blood cell count, hemoglobin levels, and other parameters. Treatment depends on the underlying cause and may include dietary changes, supplements, medications, or in severe cases, blood transfusions. Untreated anemia can lead to heart problems and other complications."
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs. The two main conditions that contribute to COPD are emphysema (damage to air sacs in the lungs) and chronic bronchitis (long-term inflammation of the airways). Symptoms include breathing difficulty, cough, mucus production, and wheezing. Smoking is the primary cause of COPD, although long-term exposure to lung irritants like air pollution or chemical fumes can also contribute. The disease typically worsens over time, but treatment can help control symptoms and slow progression. Treatments include bronchodilators, steroids, oxygen therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation, and in severe cases, lung surgery. Quitting smoking is the most important step in managing COPD. Acute exacerbations can be life-threatening and require prompt medical attention."
Dementia,"Dementia is not a specific disease but rather a general term for the impaired ability to remember, think, or make decisions that interferes with daily activities. Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia, accounting for 60-80% of cases. Other types include vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia. Symptoms gradually worsen over time and may include memory loss, difficulty with communication and language, impaired reasoning and judgment, confusion and disorientation, and personality changes. While age is the greatest risk factor, dementia isn't a normal part of aging. There's currently no cure for most types of dementia, but treatments can temporarily improve symptoms. Management focuses on maintaining mental function, managing behavioral symptoms, and slowing disease progression. Support for caregivers is an essential part of dementia care."
Renal Insufficiency,"Renal insufficiency, also called kidney insufficiency, occurs when the kidneys lose their ability to adequately filter waste products from the blood. This condition can develop suddenly (acute kidney injury) or gradually over time (chronic kidney disease). Symptoms may include fatigue, swelling in the legs and ankles, shortness of breath, confusion, nausea, and changes in urine output. Causes include diabetes, high blood pressure, glomerulonephritis, polycystic kidney disease, and prolonged obstruction of the urinary tract. As kidney function declines, waste products and excess fluid build up in the body, potentially leading to serious complications. Treatment focuses on addressing the underlying cause, managing symptoms, and slowing progression through dietary changes, medications, and in advanced cases, dialysis or kidney transplantation. Regular monitoring of kidney function is important for people at risk."
Confusion,"Confusion is a symptom that involves disorientation, difficulty thinking clearly or concentrating, and sometimes memory problems. It can range from mild (momentary forgetfulness) to severe (complete inability to recognize people or surroundings). Acute confusion that develops quickly (delirium) is particularly concerning and may indicate serious medical conditions such as infections, metabolic imbalances, medication reactions, or neurological disorders. Chronic confusion may be associated with dementia. Other symptoms accompanying confusion might include agitation, personality changes, slurred speech, or unusual behavior. Treatment depends on identifying and addressing the underlying cause. In elderly patients, confusion can sometimes be the primary symptom of conditions like urinary tract infections. Any sudden onset of confusion warrants immediate medical evaluation as it may signal a medical emergency like stroke or hypoglycemia."
Osteoarthritis,"Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, characterized by the breakdown of cartilage in joints and underlying bone changes. This degenerative joint disease most often affects weight-bearing joints like the knees, hips, and spine, as well as the hands. Symptoms include joint pain and stiffness, especially after inactivity or overuse, reduced range of motion, and sometimes swelling. As the condition progresses, bones may develop spurs and joints may make grating or crackling sounds. Risk factors include aging, joint injury, obesity, and genetic predisposition. While there's no cure, treatments can relieve pain and maintain joint function. These include weight management, physical therapy, pain medications, joint injections, and in severe cases, joint replacement surgery. Regular low-impact exercise helps maintain joint mobility and muscle strength."
Hypothyroidism,"Hypothyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid hormones, which are essential for regulating metabolism. This slowdown in bodily functions can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, dry skin, hair loss, muscle weakness, depression, and memory problems. The most common cause is Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the thyroid. Other causes include thyroid surgery, radiation treatment, certain medications, and iodine deficiency. Diagnosis is made through blood tests measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine (T4) levels. Treatment involves daily synthetic thyroid hormone replacement (levothyroxine). Properly managed, most people with hypothyroidism can lead normal lives, though medication dosage may need periodic adjustment. Untreated hypothyroidism can lead to serious complications like heart problems and myxedema coma."
Anxiety Disorder,"Anxiety disorders are a group of mental health conditions characterized by excessive and persistent fear, worry, or dread that interferes with daily activities. These include generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobias. Physical symptoms may include restlessness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, sleep disturbances, and panic attacks (sudden episodes of intense fear with physical symptoms like rapid heartbeat and shortness of breath). Anxiety disorders can be caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, psychological, and developmental factors. Treatment typically involves psychotherapy (especially cognitive-behavioral therapy), medications (such as SSRIs or benzodiazepines), or a combination. Lifestyle changes like regular exercise, stress management techniques, and adequate sleep can help manage symptoms. Without treatment, anxiety disorders can significantly impair quality of life and lead to other health problems."
Primary Malignant Neoplasm,"A primary malignant neoplasm is a cancerous tumor that originates in a specific organ or tissue, as opposed to spreading from another part of the body (metastasis). These tumors develop when normal cellular growth control mechanisms fail, allowing abnormal cells to proliferate uncontrollably and invade surrounding tissues. Symptoms vary depending on the tumor location but may include unexplained weight loss, fatigue, pain, changes in bowel or bladder habits, unusual bleeding or discharge, persistent cough, or noticeable lumps. Diagnosis typically involves imaging tests and biopsy. Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or targeted therapy, often in combination. Early detection through screening (for cancers like breast, colon, or prostate) significantly improves outcomes. Risk factors include genetic predisposition, environmental exposures (like tobacco or UV radiation), infections, and lifestyle factors."
HIV Infection,"HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infection is a chronic condition that attacks the body's immune system, specifically the CD4 cells (T cells), which help the immune system fight infections. If left untreated, HIV can lead to AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome), the most advanced stage of HIV infection. Early symptoms may include flu-like illness within 2-4 weeks after infection, followed by a long clinical latency period. As the immune system weakens, symptoms may include rapid weight loss, recurring fever, extreme fatigue, prolonged swelling of lymph glands, and opportunistic infections. HIV is spread through contact with certain body fluids, most commonly during unprotected sex or through sharing injection drug equipment. While there's no cure, antiretroviral therapy (ART) can control the virus and prevent transmission. Early diagnosis and treatment allow people with HIV to live long, healthy lives and reduce the risk of transmitting the virus."
Cellulitis,"Cellulitis is a common bacterial skin infection that affects the deeper layers of the skin and underlying tissue. It typically occurs when bacteria (usually streptococcus or staphylococcus) enter through a break in the skin. The affected area becomes red, swollen, warm, and painful, often with rapidly spreading borders. Fever and chills may accompany the skin symptoms. While cellulitis can occur anywhere on the body, it most commonly affects the lower legs. Risk factors include skin injuries, chronic skin conditions, lymphedema, obesity, and weakened immune systems. Treatment involves oral or intravenous antibiotics depending on severity. Without proper treatment, the infection can spread to lymph nodes and bloodstream, becoming life-threatening. Preventive measures include proper wound care, managing skin conditions, and controlling risk factors like diabetes. Recurrent cellulitis may require long-term preventive antibiotics."
Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease,"Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) is a chronic digestive disorder where stomach acid or bile flows back (refluxes) into the esophagus, irritating its lining. This backward flow occurs when the lower esophageal sphincter (the valve between the esophagus and stomach) weakens or relaxes inappropriately. Common symptoms include heartburn (a burning chest pain), regurgitation of sour liquid or food, difficulty swallowing, and the sensation of a lump in the throat. Nighttime symptoms may cause chronic cough, laryngitis, or disrupted sleep. Chronic GERD can lead to complications like esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus (a precancerous condition), and esophageal strictures. Treatment involves lifestyle modifications (weight loss, dietary changes, elevating the head of the bed), medications (antacids, H2 blockers, proton pump inhibitors), and in severe cases, surgery. Avoiding trigger foods like caffeine, alcohol, and fatty foods can help manage symptoms."
Sepsis,"Sepsis is a life-threatening medical emergency that occurs when the body's response to an infection causes widespread inflammation, leading to tissue damage, organ failure, and potentially death. It's the body's extreme response to an infection that has spread through the bloodstream. Symptoms may include fever, rapid heart rate, rapid breathing, confusion, extreme pain or discomfort, and clammy or sweaty skin. Severe sepsis can progress to septic shock, with dangerously low blood pressure that doesn't respond to fluid replacement. Sepsis can originate from any type of infection - bacterial, viral, or fungal - but commonly starts from pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or abdominal infections. Treatment requires immediate hospitalization, intravenous antibiotics, fluids, and medications to support blood pressure and organ function. Early recognition and treatment are crucial for survival, as sepsis can worsen rapidly. Survivors may experience long-term physical and psychological effects."
Deep Vein Thrombosis,"Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a serious condition where a blood clot forms in a deep vein, typically in the legs. The clot can partially or completely block blood flow, causing pain, swelling, redness, and warmth in the affected limb. The primary danger is that part of the clot can break off and travel to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism (a life-threatening emergency). Risk factors include prolonged immobility (such as during long flights or bed rest), surgery, injury, cancer, pregnancy, birth control pills, and genetic clotting disorders. Diagnosis involves ultrasound imaging and blood tests. Treatment typically includes blood thinners (anticoagulants) to prevent clot growth and new clots from forming. Compression stockings may be recommended to reduce swelling and prevent post-thrombotic syndrome. Prevention strategies include staying active, maintaining hydration, and using compression stockings during high-risk situations."
Dehydration,"Dehydration occurs when the body loses more fluids than it takes in, disrupting normal metabolic processes. Water is essential for numerous bodily functions including temperature regulation, joint lubrication, nutrient transportation, and waste removal. Mild to moderate dehydration symptoms include thirst, dry mouth, fatigue, decreased urine output (with dark yellow color), dry skin, dizziness, and headache. Severe dehydration can cause extreme thirst, very dry mouth and skin, lack of sweating, rapid heartbeat, rapid breathing, sunken eyes, confusion, and even unconsciousness. Causes include inadequate fluid intake, excessive sweating, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, or frequent urination (as with diabetes). Treatment involves replacing lost fluids and electrolytes, with severe cases requiring intravenous fluids in a hospital setting. Prevention includes drinking adequate fluids throughout the day, increasing intake during hot weather or exercise, and replacing fluids lost during illness. Elderly people and infants are particularly vulnerable to dehydration."
Neoplasm,"A neoplasm is an abnormal growth of tissue that results from uncontrolled, progressive multiplication of cells. Neoplasms can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Benign neoplasms grow slowly, remain localized, and generally don't spread to other parts of the body, though they may cause problems by pressing on nearby structures. Malignant neoplasms grow aggressively, invade surrounding tissues, and can metastasize (spread) to distant sites through the bloodstream or lymphatic system. Symptoms vary widely depending on the neoplasm's location and type but may include lumps, unexplained weight loss, persistent pain, changes in bowel or bladder habits, unusual bleeding, or persistent cough. Diagnosis typically involves imaging tests and biopsy. Treatment depends on the type and stage but may include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or targeted therapy. Some neoplasms are preventable through lifestyle modifications like avoiding tobacco and excessive sun exposure."
Pulmonary Embolism,"A pulmonary embolism (PE) is a sudden blockage in one of the pulmonary arteries in the lungs, usually caused by a blood clot that travels from the legs (deep vein thrombosis). This condition is life-threatening as it prevents blood from reaching parts of the lung, reducing oxygen levels in the blood and straining the heart. Symptoms may include sudden shortness of breath, sharp chest pain that worsens with deep breathing or coughing, rapid heartbeat, coughing up blood, and lightheadedness or fainting. Risk factors include prolonged immobility, surgery, certain medications, smoking, obesity, and genetic clotting disorders. Diagnosis involves CT scans, blood tests, and sometimes pulmonary angiography. Immediate treatment with blood thinners (anticoagulants) or clot-dissolving medications (thrombolytics) is crucial. In severe cases, surgical removal of the clot may be necessary. Prevention includes early mobilization after surgery, compression stockings, and blood thinners for high-risk patients."
Epilepsy,"Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent, unprovoked seizures caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Seizures can vary from brief lapses of attention or muscle jerks to severe and prolonged convulsions. The specific symptoms depend on which part of the brain is affected. Epilepsy has many possible causes including genetic factors, brain trauma, stroke, brain tumors, infections, or developmental disorders, though in many cases the cause remains unknown. Diagnosis involves detailed medical history, neurological exams, EEG (electroencephalogram), and brain imaging. Treatment typically begins with anti-seizure medications, with about 70% of patients achieving seizure control. For medication-resistant cases, options include specialized diets (like ketogenic diet), nerve stimulation devices, or brain surgery. People with epilepsy need to take precautions to prevent injuries during seizures and maintain regular medical follow-up. Most can lead full, active lives with proper management."
Cardiomyopathy,"Cardiomyopathy refers to diseases of the heart muscle that make it harder for the heart to pump blood to the rest of the body. There are several types: dilated (enlarged ventricles), hypertrophic (thickened heart muscle), restrictive (stiff heart muscle), and arrhythmogenic (replacement of muscle with fatty tissue). Symptoms may include breathlessness with exertion or at rest, swelling of the legs and feet, fatigue, irregular heartbeats, dizziness, and fainting. Causes include genetic factors, long-term high blood pressure, heart tissue damage from heart attacks, chronic rapid heart rate, metabolic disorders, or excessive alcohol use. Treatment depends on the type and severity but may include medications, surgically implanted devices (like pacemakers), or in severe cases, heart transplant. Lifestyle changes like salt restriction and avoiding alcohol are often recommended. Some forms of cardiomyopathy can lead to heart failure if not properly managed."
Chronic Kidney Failure,"Chronic kidney failure, also called chronic kidney disease (CKD), is the gradual loss of kidney function over time. Healthy kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from the blood, which are then excreted in urine. As CKD progresses, dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes, and wastes can build up in the body. In early stages, there may be few symptoms, but as kidney function worsens, symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, fatigue, sleep problems, changes in urine output, muscle cramps, swelling of feet and ankles, and persistent itching. The two main causes are diabetes and high blood pressure. Other causes include glomerulonephritis, polycystic kidney disease, and prolonged urinary tract obstruction. Treatment focuses on slowing progression through blood pressure control, dietary changes, and managing underlying conditions. End-stage kidney disease requires dialysis or kidney transplantation."
Carcinoma,"Carcinoma is a type of cancer that begins in the epithelial cells that line the internal and external surfaces of the body. These account for about 80-90% of all cancer cases. Major types include adenocarcinoma (glandular tissues), squamous cell carcinoma (surface epithelium), and basal cell carcinoma (skin). Carcinomas can develop in many organs including the lungs, breasts, prostate, colon, pancreas, and skin. Symptoms vary by location but may include lumps, unusual bleeding, persistent pain, changes in bowel or bladder habits, unexplained weight loss, or skin changes. Risk factors include tobacco use, excessive sun exposure, certain infections, radiation, and genetic predisposition. Diagnosis typically involves biopsy and imaging tests. Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, often in combination. Early detection through screening (like mammograms or colonoscopies) significantly improves outcomes for many carcinomas."
Hepatitis C,"Hepatitis C is a viral infection that primarily affects the liver, caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). The infection can range from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong condition that leads to cirrhosis or liver cancer. Many people with acute hepatitis C don't experience symptoms, though some may have fever, fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, and jaundice. Chronic infection often progresses silently for decades until liver damage becomes significant. HCV is spread through contact with infected blood, most commonly through sharing needles or other equipment to inject drugs, unsafe medical procedures, or before widespread screening of blood products (prior to 1992). Unlike hepatitis B, sexual transmission is less common. Modern antiviral medications can cure over 90% of hepatitis C cases with 8-12 weeks of oral treatment. Without treatment, chronic hepatitis C can lead to serious liver complications requiring transplantation."
Peripheral Vascular Disease,"Peripheral vascular disease (PVD), also called peripheral artery disease (PAD), refers to narrowed or blocked blood vessels outside the heart and brain, typically affecting arteries supplying the legs. This narrowing is usually caused by atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in artery walls). The most common symptom is intermittent claudication - leg pain or cramping during activity that improves with rest. Other symptoms may include leg numbness or weakness, coldness in lower leg or foot, sores that won't heal, and color changes in the skin. Severe PAD can lead to critical limb ischemia with pain at rest and tissue loss. Risk factors include smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and older age. Treatment focuses on lifestyle changes (smoking cessation, exercise), medications to improve blood flow and prevent clots, and in advanced cases, angioplasty or bypass surgery. Untreated PAD increases risk of heart attack and stroke."
Psychotic Disorder,"Psychotic disorders are severe mental illnesses characterized by distorted thinking and awareness, with two main symptoms: hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't there) and delusions (false fixed beliefs). The most common psychotic disorder is schizophrenia. Other types include schizoaffective disorder, brief psychotic disorder, and delusional disorder. Symptoms may also include disorganized speech and behavior, lack of emotional expression, and difficulty functioning in daily life. These disorders typically emerge in late adolescence or early adulthood and have genetic and environmental causes. Treatment involves antipsychotic medications combined with psychotherapy and social support services. Early intervention is crucial as prolonged untreated psychosis can worsen long-term outcomes. While these are chronic conditions, many people with psychotic disorders can achieve significant recovery with proper treatment and support. Hospitalization may be needed during acute episodes when safety is a concern."
Hyperlipidemia,"Hyperlipidemia refers to elevated levels of lipids (fats) in the blood, including cholesterol and triglycerides. This condition is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis (hardening and narrowing of arteries) and cardiovascular diseases like heart attack and stroke. There are different types: high LDL ('bad' cholesterol), low HDL ('good' cholesterol), high triglycerides, or combinations of these. Most people with hyperlipidemia have no symptoms until serious complications develop. Causes include genetic factors (familial hypercholesterolemia), unhealthy diet high in saturated and trans fats, obesity, diabetes, hypothyroidism, and certain medications. Treatment focuses on lifestyle changes (heart-healthy diet, regular exercise, smoking cessation) and often cholesterol-lowering medications like statins. Regular lipid profile testing is important for early detection and monitoring treatment effectiveness. Untreated severe hyperlipidemia can lead to premature cardiovascular disease."
Bipolar Disorder,"Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition characterized by extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). During manic episodes, individuals may feel euphoric, full of energy, or unusually irritable, with decreased need for sleep, racing thoughts, and impulsive behaviors like spending sprees. Depressive episodes involve feelings of sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest in activities, and sometimes suicidal thoughts. There are several types including bipolar I (with severe mania), bipolar II (with milder hypomania), and cyclothymic disorder. The exact cause is unknown but involves genetic, biological and environmental factors. Treatment typically includes mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, psychotherapy, and lifestyle management. Without treatment, bipolar disorder tends to worsen over time and can lead to serious consequences including suicide attempts, substance abuse, and relationship problems. Regular sleep and stress reduction are important for managing the condition."
Obesity,"Obesity is a complex disease involving excessive body fat accumulation that presents a risk to health. It's typically defined by a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher. Obesity increases the likelihood of various diseases including heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, certain cancers, and osteoarthritis. Contributing factors include genetic predisposition, overeating high-calorie foods, physical inactivity, certain medications, psychological factors, and social determinants of health. Complications can include sleep apnea, fatty liver disease, and mental health issues like depression. Treatment involves creating a calorie deficit through dietary changes, increased physical activity, and behavior modification. In some cases, medications or bariatric surgery may be considered. Obesity management requires long-term lifestyle changes rather than short-term diets. Prevention strategies focus on healthy eating patterns and regular physical activity from childhood onward."
Ischemia,"Ischemia refers to insufficient blood flow to tissues, resulting in reduced oxygen and nutrient supply. This can occur in various organs including the heart (cardiac ischemia), brain (cerebral ischemia), or limbs (peripheral ischemia). Symptoms depend on the affected area but may include pain (like angina in heart ischemia), dysfunction of the affected organ, or in severe cases, tissue death (infarction). Common causes include atherosclerosis (narrowed arteries from plaque buildup), blood clots, or vasospasm. Risk factors include smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and family history. Treatment aims to restore blood flow (through medications, angioplasty, or surgery) and prevent further damage. Immediate treatment is crucial for acute ischemia like heart attack or stroke to prevent permanent damage. Chronic ischemia may require long-term management of underlying conditions and lifestyle modifications."
Cirrhosis,"Cirrhosis is late-stage scarring (fibrosis) of the liver caused by many forms of liver diseases and conditions, such as chronic alcoholism and hepatitis. As healthy liver tissue is replaced by scar tissue, the liver's ability to function deteriorates. Early symptoms may include fatigue, weakness, weight loss, nausea, and abdominal pain. As the disease progresses, symptoms can include jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes), easy bruising or bleeding, swelling in legs and abdomen (edema and ascites), confusion (hepatic encephalopathy), and spider-like blood vessels on the skin. Complications include portal hypertension, increased risk of liver cancer, and complete liver failure. While existing liver damage is permanent, treatment focuses on managing underlying causes (like alcohol cessation or antiviral medications for hepatitis), preventing further damage, and managing complications. Advanced cirrhosis may require liver transplantation."
Exanthema,"Exanthema refers to a widespread rash that typically appears abruptly and affects large areas of the body. These rashes are often associated with viral infections in children (like measles, rubella, or roseola) but can also occur in adults. The rash may consist of red spots, bumps, or blotches that can be flat or raised, and may or may not itch. Other symptoms often accompany the rash, such as fever, headache, fatigue, and body aches. The specific pattern and progression of the rash can help identify the underlying cause. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms (with antihistamines for itching or fever reducers) and addressing the underlying infection if necessary. Most viral exanthems resolve on their own within days to weeks. Bacterial causes (like scarlet fever) require antibiotic treatment. Keeping the skin moisturized and avoiding irritants can help with comfort during healing."
Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy,"Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) is a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland that commonly occurs in older men. As the prostate grows, it can squeeze the urethra and cause problems with urination. Symptoms may include frequent or urgent need to urinate, difficulty starting urination, weak urine stream, dribbling at the end of urination, inability to completely empty the bladder, and nocturia (frequent urination at night). While BPH doesn't increase prostate cancer risk, the symptoms can significantly affect quality of life. Causes are related to hormonal changes associated with aging. Treatment options range from watchful waiting for mild cases to medications (alpha blockers, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors), minimally invasive procedures, or surgery for severe cases. Lifestyle modifications like limiting fluids before bedtime and avoiding caffeine/alcohol can help manage symptoms. Regular check-ups are important to monitor progression."
Acute Kidney Failure,"Acute kidney failure (acute kidney injury) occurs when the kidneys suddenly lose their ability to filter waste products from the blood. This can develop over hours to days and causes dangerous accumulation of waste products and electrolyte imbalances. Symptoms may include decreased urine output, fluid retention causing swelling in legs and feet, fatigue, shortness of breath, confusion, nausea, chest pain, or in severe cases, seizures. Causes include severe dehydration, blood loss, heart failure, medications, infections, or direct kidney damage. Treatment focuses on addressing the underlying cause while supporting kidney function, which may include intravenous fluids, medications, temporary dialysis, and dietary modifications. Many cases are reversible if treated promptly, though severe cases can lead to permanent damage or chronic kidney disease. Prevention involves staying hydrated, monitoring medications that affect kidney function, and managing chronic conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure."
Mitral Valve Insufficiency,"Mitral valve insufficiency (or regurgitation) is a heart condition where the mitral valve doesn't close tightly, allowing blood to flow backward into the left atrium when the left ventricle contracts. This forces the heart to work harder to pump enough blood forward. Mild cases may cause no symptoms for years, but as the condition worsens, symptoms can include fatigue, shortness of breath (especially with activity or when lying flat), palpitations, swollen feet or ankles, and coughing. Causes include mitral valve prolapse, rheumatic fever, heart attack, cardiomyopathy, or congenital defects. Treatment depends on severity and may include medications to reduce symptoms and surgical repair or replacement of the valve in advanced cases. Regular monitoring with echocardiograms is important to assess progression. Untreated severe mitral regurgitation can lead to heart failure or abnormal heart rhythms."
Arthritis,"Arthritis is inflammation of one or more joints, causing pain and stiffness that typically worsens with age. The two most common types are osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease from wear and tear) and rheumatoid arthritis (an autoimmune disorder). Symptoms include joint pain, swelling, stiffness (especially morning stiffness lasting more than an hour), decreased range of motion, and sometimes redness or warmth around the joint. Arthritis can affect any joint but commonly involves hands, knees, hips, and spine. Risk factors include age, family history, previous joint injury, and obesity. Treatment aims to reduce symptoms and improve joint function through medications (pain relievers, anti-inflammatories, disease-modifying drugs), physical therapy, assistive devices, and sometimes surgery. Lifestyle modifications like weight management and regular low-impact exercise can help maintain joint mobility and muscle strength. There's no cure for most forms of arthritis, but early treatment can help slow progression."
Bronchitis,"Bronchitis is inflammation of the bronchial tubes (airways that carry air to the lungs). Acute bronchitis is usually caused by viruses (like those causing colds and flu) and typically improves within 10 days, though the cough may linger for weeks. Chronic bronchitis, a type of COPD, is a long-term condition often caused by smoking. Symptoms include persistent cough that produces mucus (sputum), wheezing, chest discomfort, fatigue, and sometimes mild fever and chills. Acute bronchitis is usually self-limiting and treated with rest, fluids, and over-the-counter medications for symptom relief. Chronic bronchitis requires long-term management including smoking cessation, bronchodilators, steroids, and pulmonary rehabilitation. Prevention includes handwashing to avoid viral infections, avoiding lung irritants (especially tobacco smoke), and getting vaccinated against flu and pneumonia. Severe or persistent symptoms may indicate pneumonia or other complications requiring medical attention."
Disease,Overview
Hemiparesis,"Hemiparesis is a condition characterized by weakness or partial paralysis on one side of the body, affecting either the left or right side. This neurological impairment typically results from damage to the brain's motor pathways, most commonly caused by stroke, but can also occur due to brain tumors, traumatic brain injuries, multiple sclerosis, or cerebral palsy. The severity can range from mild weakness to complete paralysis of the affected side. Patients may experience difficulty with walking, balance, grasping objects, or performing fine motor tasks. Other symptoms may include muscle stiffness, poor coordination, and fatigue. Treatment involves physical therapy to improve strength and mobility, occupational therapy to regain daily living skills, and sometimes medications to manage spasticity. Early rehabilitation is crucial for optimal recovery. The prognosis depends on the underlying cause and extent of brain damage, with some patients achieving significant improvement over time."
Osteoporosis,"Osteoporosis is a progressive bone disease characterized by decreased bone density and quality, leading to an increased risk of fractures. Often called a 'silent disease,' it typically shows no symptoms until a fracture occurs, most commonly in the hip, spine, or wrist. Bones become porous and fragile due to an imbalance between bone resorption and formation, which accelerates after menopause in women and with aging in both sexes. Risk factors include family history, low calcium intake, vitamin D deficiency, sedentary lifestyle, smoking, excessive alcohol use, and certain medications like corticosteroids. Diagnosis is made through bone density scans (DEXA). Treatment focuses on calcium and vitamin D supplementation, weight-bearing exercise, and medications that slow bone loss or promote bone formation. Preventive measures should begin early in life by building strong bones through proper nutrition and exercise."
Transient Ischemic Attack,"A Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA), often called a 'mini-stroke,' is a temporary period of symptoms similar to those of a stroke but typically lasting less than an hour without permanent brain damage. TIAs occur when blood flow to part of the brain is briefly blocked, usually by a blood clot or atherosclerosis. Symptoms may include sudden weakness or numbness on one side of the body, slurred speech, vision problems, dizziness, or confusion. Although the symptoms resolve completely, TIAs are serious warning signs of an impending stroke, with about 1 in 3 people who experience a TIA later having a full stroke. Immediate medical attention is crucial to identify the cause and implement preventive treatments, which may include blood thinners, cholesterol medications, blood pressure control, or surgery for carotid artery narrowing. Lifestyle changes like smoking cessation and improved diet are also essential components of prevention."
Adenocarcinoma,"Adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer that develops in the glandular cells lining various internal organs, accounting for many common cancers including those of the lung, breast, prostate, pancreas, and colon. These malignant tumors form in mucus-secreting glands throughout the body and can spread to other tissues through metastasis. Symptoms vary by location but may include unexplained weight loss, fatigue, pain, changes in bowel or bladder habits, unusual bleeding, or persistent cough. Risk factors depend on the specific organ involved but often include smoking, obesity, family history, and exposure to certain chemicals or radiation. Diagnosis typically involves imaging tests and biopsy. Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, often in combination. Prognosis depends on the cancer's stage at diagnosis and its specific characteristics. Regular screenings can help detect some adenocarcinomas early when treatment is most effective."
Paranoia,"Paranoia is a thought process characterized by irrational and persistent feelings of persecution, mistrust, or exaggerated self-importance. It can range from mild suspiciousness to severe delusional beliefs that others are plotting harm. Clinical paranoia may occur in psychiatric disorders like paranoid schizophrenia, delusional disorder, or paranoid personality disorder, or can be induced by substance abuse, dementia, or extreme stress. Symptoms include unfounded suspicions, hypersensitivity to criticism, inability to relax, argumentativeness, and sometimes aggressive behavior. The paranoid individual often misinterprets benign events as personal attacks and may isolate themselves socially. Treatment typically involves antipsychotic medications combined with psychotherapy to help the person develop more realistic perspectives. Cognitive behavioral therapy can be particularly helpful in challenging irrational beliefs. Support from family and friends is important, though the paranoid person may initially reject such support. Without treatment, paranoia can significantly impair relationships and daily functioning."
Pancreatitis,"Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas, a gland behind the stomach that produces digestive enzymes and insulin. Acute pancreatitis occurs suddenly and can be life-threatening, with symptoms including severe upper abdominal pain radiating to the back, nausea, vomiting, fever, and rapid pulse. Causes include gallstones, alcohol abuse, certain medications, infections, or trauma. Chronic pancreatitis develops over time, causing permanent damage that leads to diabetes and digestive problems. Symptoms include persistent abdominal pain, weight loss, and oily, foul-smelling stools. Diagnosis involves blood tests (checking pancreatic enzymes), imaging like CT scans or MRCP, and sometimes endoscopic procedures. Treatment for acute cases requires hospitalization with IV fluids, pain control, and fasting to rest the pancreas. Chronic cases may need enzyme supplements, insulin, and pain management. Severe complications can include pancreatic necrosis, pseudocysts, or pancreatic cancer. Prevention focuses on avoiding alcohol and managing risk factors like gallstones."
Incontinence,"Urinary incontinence is the involuntary leakage of urine that can range from occasional minor leaks to complete loss of bladder control. There are several types: stress incontinence (leakage with coughing/sneezing), urge incontinence (sudden intense urge followed by leakage), overflow incontinence (constant dribbling from full bladder), and functional incontinence (physical or mental impairment preventing timely bathroom use). Causes include weakened pelvic muscles (often from childbirth or prostate surgery), nerve damage, urinary tract infections, constipation, or certain medications. Fecal incontinence (loss of bowel control) may also occur, especially in elderly individuals. Treatment options include pelvic floor exercises (Kegels), bladder training, medications, medical devices (pessaries), or surgery for severe cases. Lifestyle changes like managing fluid intake, avoiding bladder irritants (caffeine, alcohol), and maintaining a healthy weight can help. While common, especially in older adults, incontinence shouldn't be considered an inevitable part of aging and can often be improved with proper treatment."
Paroxysmal Dyspnea,"Paroxysmal dyspnea refers to sudden episodes of severe shortness of breath that typically occur at night, waking the person from sleep (paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea). This is a classic symptom of heart failure, where lying flat causes fluid to redistribute from the legs to the lungs, making breathing difficult. The person may gasp for air and need to sit upright or open a window for relief. Other causes include asthma attacks, pulmonary embolism, panic attacks, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The episodes may be accompanied by wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, or palpitations. Diagnosis involves evaluating heart and lung function through physical exams, chest X-rays, echocardiograms, or pulmonary function tests. Treatment targets the underlying condition and may include diuretics to remove excess fluid, bronchodilators for asthma/COPD, or anticoagulants for pulmonary embolism. Managing fluid intake, elevating the head during sleep, and avoiding late-night meals can help prevent episodes. Severe or recurrent episodes require prompt medical evaluation."
Hernia,"A hernia occurs when an organ or fatty tissue squeezes through a weak spot in a surrounding muscle or connective tissue. Common types include inguinal (groin), hiatal (upper stomach), umbilical (belly button), and incisional (resulting from surgical scars). Symptoms range from a painless bulge to severe pain, especially when straining, lifting, or coughing. Complications can include incarceration (hernia gets stuck) or strangulation (blood supply cut off), which are medical emergencies requiring immediate surgery. Risk factors include age, chronic coughing, constipation, obesity, pregnancy, and heavy lifting. Diagnosis is typically through physical examination, sometimes with ultrasound or CT scan. Treatment depends on symptoms and hernia type, with watchful waiting for small, asymptomatic hernias to surgical repair (herniorrhaphy or hernioplasty) for painful or enlarging hernias. Prevention focuses on maintaining healthy weight, proper lifting techniques, treating persistent coughs, and avoiding straining during bowel movements. Recurrence after surgery is possible, especially with underlying tissue weakness."
Prostate Carcinoma,"Prostate cancer is a malignant tumor that develops in the prostate gland, a walnut-sized organ in men that produces seminal fluid. It's one of the most common cancers in men, typically growing slowly and initially confined to the prostate gland. Symptoms may include difficulty urinating, decreased force in urine stream, blood in semen, pelvic discomfort, bone pain (in advanced cases), and erectile dysfunction. Risk factors include older age, African-American ethnicity, family history, and obesity. Screening involves PSA blood tests and digital rectal exams, though screening recommendations vary by age and risk factors. Diagnosis is confirmed through prostate biopsy. Treatment options range from active surveillance for low-risk cancers to surgery (prostatectomy), radiation therapy, hormone therapy, chemotherapy, or newer targeted treatments for advanced cases. Side effects of treatment may include urinary incontinence and sexual dysfunction. Early-stage prostate cancer often has an excellent prognosis, while advanced cases can spread to bones and other organs."
Pulmonary Edema,"Pulmonary edema is a condition caused by excess fluid accumulation in the lungs' air sacs (alveoli), making breathing difficult. It can develop suddenly (acute) or gradually (chronic). The most common cause is heart failure (cardiogenic pulmonary edema), where the heart can't pump blood effectively, causing pressure buildup in lung veins. Non-cardiogenic causes include pneumonia, smoke inhalation, high altitudes, or certain medications. Symptoms include extreme shortness of breath, feeling of suffocation, frothy pink sputum, wheezing, anxiety, and cold, clammy skin. Severe cases can lead to respiratory failure. Diagnosis involves physical exam, chest X-ray, echocardiogram, and blood tests. Emergency treatment includes oxygen therapy, diuretics to remove fluid, and medications to strengthen heart contractions and reduce blood pressure. For chronic cases, managing underlying heart conditions with medications like ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers is essential. Preventive measures include controlling blood pressure, avoiding excessive salt intake, and adhering to heart failure treatment plans. Without prompt treatment, pulmonary edema can be life-threatening."
Lymphatic Diseases,"Lymphatic diseases encompass disorders affecting the lymphatic system, a crucial part of the immune and circulatory systems that transports lymph fluid containing white blood cells throughout the body. Common lymphatic disorders include lymphedema (chronic swelling from lymph fluid buildup, often after cancer treatment), lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes from infection or cancer), lymphoma (cancer of lymph cells), and lymphatic filariasis (parasitic infection causing elephantiasis). Symptoms vary but may include persistent swelling (especially in arms or legs), recurrent infections, fatigue, fever, and enlarged lymph nodes. Causes range from infections, genetic conditions, cancer treatments damaging lymph nodes, to autoimmune disorders. Diagnosis involves physical exams, imaging (CT, MRI, lymphangiogram), and sometimes lymph node biopsy. Treatment depends on the specific condition but may include compression garments, manual lymph drainage, antibiotics for infections, chemotherapy/radiation for cancers, or surgery in severe cases. Preventive measures include proper skin care to avoid infections in affected limbs and avoiding blood pressure measurements or injections in limbs with lymphedema."
Aortic Valve Stenosis,"Aortic valve stenosis is a narrowing of the aortic valve opening that restricts blood flow from the heart's left ventricle to the aorta and the rest of the body. This forces the heart to work harder, potentially leading to heart failure. Causes include congenital valve abnormalities, calcium buildup on the valve with aging, or rheumatic fever. Symptoms often develop gradually and may include chest pain, fatigue, shortness of breath (especially with exertion), heart palpitations, and fainting spells. Severe cases can cause sudden cardiac death. Diagnosis involves listening for a heart murmur, echocardiogram, ECG, and cardiac catheterization. Treatment depends on severity, ranging from regular monitoring for mild cases to valve replacement surgery (either open-heart or transcatheter) for severe stenosis. Medications can help manage symptoms but don't fix the valve problem. People with aortic stenosis need antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures to prevent endocarditis. Without treatment, severe symptomatic aortic stenosis has a poor prognosis."
Breast Carcinoma,"Breast cancer is a malignant tumor that develops from breast cells, typically beginning in the milk ducts (ductal carcinoma) or lobules (lobular carcinoma). It's the most common cancer in women worldwide. Symptoms may include a breast lump or thickening, changes in breast size or shape, nipple discharge or inversion, skin dimpling (like an orange peel), or redness. Risk factors include female gender, increasing age, family history, BRCA gene mutations, early menstruation/late menopause, obesity after menopause, alcohol use, and hormone therapy. Screening involves regular mammograms, with MRI recommended for high-risk individuals. Diagnosis is confirmed through biopsy. Treatment options include surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy), radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy for hormone receptor-positive cancers, and targeted therapies like HER2 inhibitors. Prognosis depends on cancer stage, type, and molecular characteristics. Early detection through screening improves survival rates significantly. Men can also develop breast cancer, though it's much less common."
Schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia is a severe, chronic mental disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves, often characterized by episodes of psychosis including hallucinations (typically hearing voices) and delusions (fixed false beliefs). Other symptoms include disorganized speech and behavior, reduced emotional expression, and cognitive difficulties with memory and concentration. The condition typically emerges in late adolescence or early adulthood and has genetic and environmental causes. Treatment involves antipsychotic medications to manage symptoms combined with psychosocial therapies (cognitive behavioral therapy, social skills training) and supported employment/education programs. Hospitalization may be needed during acute psychotic episodes. Long-term management is essential as schizophrenia is associated with higher risks of suicide, homelessness, and physical health problems. While there's no cure, many people with schizophrenia can achieve significant recovery with proper treatment and support. Family education and support groups are valuable resources for caregivers. Substance abuse can worsen symptoms and should be avoided."
Diverticulitis,"Diverticulitis is inflammation or infection of small pouches (diverticula) that can form in the wall of the colon, especially in the sigmoid colon. It typically causes sudden abdominal pain (usually in the lower left side), fever, nausea, and changes in bowel habits. Severe cases can lead to abscesses, perforations, or peritonitis. Risk factors include aging, low-fiber diet, obesity, smoking, and lack of exercise. Diagnosis involves physical exam, blood tests, and imaging like CT scans. Mild cases are treated with oral antibiotics, clear liquid diet, and pain management, while severe cases may require hospitalization with IV antibiotics and possibly surgery to remove the affected colon section. After recovery, a high-fiber diet is recommended to prevent recurrence, though nuts and seeds need not be avoided as previously thought. Complications like fistulas or bowel obstructions may require additional interventions. Preventive measures include regular exercise, adequate hydration, and maintaining healthy bowel habits."
Fluid Overload,"Fluid overload, also called hypervolemia, occurs when the body retains excessive amounts of water and sodium, often due to impaired kidney function or heart failure. Symptoms include swelling (edema) in legs, feet, and hands, rapid weight gain, shortness of breath (from pulmonary edema), high blood pressure, and abdominal bloating. Causes include kidney disease, heart failure, liver cirrhosis, certain medications (like NSAIDs), and excessive sodium intake. Diagnosis involves physical examination, blood tests to check kidney function and electrolytes, urine tests, and sometimes echocardiography. Treatment focuses on diuretics to promote fluid excretion, dietary sodium restriction (typically less than 2,000 mg/day), fluid intake limitations in severe cases, and addressing the underlying condition. Severe cases may require hospitalization for IV diuretics or dialysis in kidney failure. Monitoring daily weight helps detect fluid accumulation early. Untreated fluid overload can lead to dangerous complications like congestive heart failure, pleural effusions, or electrolyte imbalances affecting heart rhythm."
Peptic Ulcer,"Peptic ulcers are open sores that develop on the inner lining of the stomach (gastric ulcers) or upper small intestine (duodenal ulcers). The most common causes are Helicobacter pylori bacterial infection and long-term use of NSAIDs (like aspirin or ibuprofen). Symptoms include burning stomach pain (often worse when stomach is empty), bloating, heartburn, nausea, and sometimes vomiting blood or black tarry stools from bleeding ulcers. Complications can include internal bleeding, perforation (hole in stomach wall), or gastric outlet obstruction. Diagnosis involves endoscopy with biopsy (to check for H. pylori or cancer) and sometimes breath or stool tests for H. pylori. Treatment includes antibiotics for H. pylori infection, acid-reducing medications (PPIs, H2 blockers), and avoiding NSAIDs. Lifestyle changes like reducing stress, avoiding spicy foods (if they worsen symptoms), and limiting alcohol may help but aren't primary treatments. Most ulcers heal with proper treatment, though recurrence is possible without eradicating H. pylori or continuing NSAID use."
Osteomyelitis,"Osteomyelitis is a bone infection typically caused by bacteria (often Staphylococcus aureus) that can reach the bone through the bloodstream, from nearby infected tissue, or directly through trauma or surgery. Symptoms include fever, bone pain, swelling, warmth and redness over the affected area, and sometimes drainage of pus. Risk factors include diabetes, poor circulation, recent injury or surgery, intravenous drug use, and weakened immune systems. Diagnosis involves blood tests (elevated white blood cells and inflammatory markers), imaging (X-rays, MRI, bone scans), and bone biopsy to identify the causative organism. Treatment requires prolonged (often 4-6 weeks) intravenous antibiotics, sometimes followed by oral antibiotics. Severe cases may require surgical debridement to remove infected bone tissue. Complications can include bone death (osteonecrosis), spread of infection, impaired bone growth in children, or chronic osteomyelitis requiring long-term management. Preventive measures include proper wound care, especially in diabetics, and prompt treatment of infections that could spread to bone."
Gastritis,"Gastritis is inflammation of the stomach lining that can occur suddenly (acute) or gradually (chronic). Common causes include H. pylori infection, excessive alcohol consumption, chronic use of NSAIDs, stress, autoimmune disorders, and bile reflux. Symptoms may include upper abdominal pain or burning, nausea, vomiting, bloating, loss of appetite, and in severe cases, black stools from bleeding. Some people, especially with chronic gastritis, may have few symptoms until complications like ulcers develop. Diagnosis involves medical history, physical exam, and sometimes endoscopy with biopsy. Treatment depends on the cause but may include antibiotics for H. pylori, acid-reducing medications (proton pump inhibitors, H2 blockers), antacids, and avoiding irritants like alcohol and NSAIDs. Dietary modifications (avoiding spicy, acidic, or fatty foods if they worsen symptoms) may help. Chronic untreated gastritis can lead to stomach ulcers, anemia from chronic bleeding, or increased risk of stomach cancer in cases of atrophic gastritis. Most cases improve quickly with proper treatment."
Bacteremia,"Bacteremia is the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream that can occur from infections elsewhere in the body, medical procedures, or intravenous drug use. While transient bacteremia may be harmless in healthy individuals, persistent bacteremia can lead to serious systemic infection (sepsis). Symptoms may include fever, chills, rapid breathing, rapid heart rate, and in severe cases, confusion or decreased consciousness. Risk factors include recent surgery, invasive medical devices (like catheters), weakened immune system, and chronic illnesses like diabetes. Diagnosis is made through blood cultures, with additional tests to identify the source of infection. Treatment requires prompt administration of intravenous antibiotics tailored to the specific bacteria, along with supportive care for sepsis if present. The source of infection (such as an abscess or infected device) may need drainage or removal. Complications can include endocarditis, osteomyelitis, or septic shock. Preventive measures include proper sterile techniques during medical procedures, prompt treatment of infections, and prophylactic antibiotics for high-risk patients before certain procedures."
Kidney Failure,"Kidney failure (renal failure) occurs when the kidneys lose their ability to sufficiently filter waste products from the blood. Acute kidney injury develops suddenly, often due to decreased blood flow (from severe dehydration or blood loss), direct kidney damage, or urinary obstruction. Chronic kidney disease progresses gradually over months to years, typically from diabetes, hypertension, or glomerulonephritis. Symptoms may include decreased urine output, fluid retention causing swelling, fatigue, nausea, confusion, and shortness of breath. End-stage kidney disease requires dialysis or transplantation to sustain life. Diagnosis involves blood tests (creatinine, BUN), urine tests, and imaging. Treatment focuses on addressing the underlying cause, managing complications (like anemia or bone disease), and slowing progression through blood pressure control (often with ACE inhibitors) and dietary modifications (protein, potassium, phosphorus restrictions). Dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal) filters the blood artificially when kidneys fail. Preventive measures include controlling diabetes and hypertension, avoiding nephrotoxic medications when possible, and staying hydrated."
Sickle Cell Anemia,"Sickle cell anemia is an inherited form of anemia where red blood cells become rigid and crescent-shaped (sickle) instead of flexible and round, causing them to get stuck in small blood vessels. This leads to pain crises, infections, and damage to organs. Symptoms typically begin in infancy and may include episodes of severe pain (especially in bones, chest, and abdomen), fatigue, jaundice (yellowish skin), frequent infections, delayed growth, and vision problems. Complications can include stroke, acute chest syndrome, organ damage, and leg ulcers. The disease is caused by a mutation in the hemoglobin gene and is most common in people of African, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern descent. Diagnosis is through newborn screening or hemoglobin electrophoresis. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications with pain medications, hydroxyurea to reduce crises, blood transfusions, vaccinations, and sometimes bone marrow transplant. Regular medical care is essential to monitor for complications. Recent advances in gene therapy offer promising future treatments."
Heart Failure,"Heart failure occurs when the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. It can affect the left side (causing fluid buildup in lungs), right side (causing fluid in abdomen and legs), or both. Symptoms include shortness of breath (especially when lying flat or with exertion), fatigue, swelling in legs and feet, rapid weight gain from fluid retention, and persistent coughing. Common causes include coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, previous heart attack, and cardiomyopathy. Diagnosis involves physical exam, blood tests (BNP), echocardiogram, and sometimes cardiac catheterization. Treatment includes lifestyle changes (low-salt diet, fluid restriction, exercise), medications (ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, diuretics), and devices like pacemakers or defibrillators for some patients. Severe cases may require ventricular assist devices or heart transplantation. Managing underlying conditions and adhering to treatment can improve quality of life and survival. Heart failure is typically chronic and progressive, though proper management can slow its course significantly."
Upper Respiratory Infection,"Upper respiratory infections (URIs) are common illnesses affecting the nose, throat, sinuses, and larynx, typically caused by viruses like rhinovirus, coronavirus, or influenza. Symptoms include runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, cough, sneezing, mild fever, headache, and fatigue. Most URIs (like the common cold) are mild and self-limiting, resolving within 7-10 days. Influenza may cause more severe symptoms including high fever, body aches, and extreme fatigue. Diagnosis is usually based on symptoms, with testing sometimes done for influenza or COVID-19. Treatment focuses on symptom relief with rest, fluids, pain relievers, decongestants, and throat lozenges. Antibiotics are ineffective against viruses. Complications can include sinusitis, ear infections, or pneumonia. Prevention involves frequent handwashing, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and vaccinations (flu vaccine, COVID-19 vaccine). People with weakened immune systems, asthma, or other chronic conditions are at higher risk for complications and should seek medical attention if symptoms worsen."
Hepatitis,"Hepatitis refers to inflammation of the liver that can be caused by viruses (hepatitis A, B, C, D, E), alcohol abuse, toxins, certain medications, or autoimmune diseases. Symptoms range from mild to severe and may include fatigue, jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes), dark urine, pale stools, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea, and fever. Acute hepatitis may resolve on its own or progress to chronic infection (especially hepatitis B and C), potentially leading to cirrhosis or liver cancer. Diagnosis involves blood tests to assess liver function and identify the cause, and sometimes imaging or liver biopsy. Treatment depends on the type: hepatitis A typically requires only supportive care; hepatitis B may need antiviral medications; hepatitis C is now curable with direct-acting antivirals. Prevention includes vaccination (for hepatitis A and B), safe injection practices, safe sex, and avoiding alcohol with liver disease. Chronic hepatitis requires regular monitoring for liver damage progression."
Pulmonary Hypertension,"Pulmonary hypertension is a type of high blood pressure that affects the arteries in the lungs and the right side of the heart. Unlike systemic hypertension, this condition specifically increases pressure in the pulmonary arteries, making the heart work harder to pump blood to the lungs. Symptoms develop gradually and may include shortness of breath (initially with exertion, later at rest), fatigue, dizziness, chest pressure, swelling in ankles/legs, and bluish lips/skin. Causes include left heart disease, lung diseases, chronic blood clots, connective tissue disorders, or genetic factors. Diagnosis involves echocardiogram, right heart catheterization, and tests to identify underlying causes. Treatment includes oxygen therapy, diuretics, blood thinners, and specialized medications that dilate pulmonary arteries (endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, prostacyclins). Severe cases may require lung transplantation. While there's no cure, treatment can improve symptoms and slow progression. Regular follow-up with a specialist is essential, as untreated pulmonary hypertension can lead to right heart failure."
Deglutition Disorder,"Deglutition disorders (swallowing difficulties), also called dysphagia, can occur at any stage of the swallowing process from the mouth to the stomach. Causes include neurological conditions (stroke, Parkinson's, ALS), muscular disorders, esophageal strictures, tumors, or GERD. Symptoms may include pain while swallowing, inability to swallow, sensation of food stuck in throat or chest, drooling, regurgitation, frequent heartburn, and unintended weight loss. Complications can include aspiration pneumonia from food/liquid entering lungs, malnutrition, and dehydration. Diagnosis involves swallowing studies (videofluoroscopy or endoscopy), esophageal manometry, or imaging tests. Treatment depends on the cause and may include dietary modifications (thickened liquids, soft foods), swallowing therapy with a speech-language pathologist, medications for GERD or spasms, esophageal dilation for strictures, or surgery for structural problems. Severe cases may require feeding tubes. Management focuses on preventing complications while maintaining adequate nutrition and hydration. Patients with persistent dysphagia should be evaluated for underlying serious conditions."
Gout,"Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by elevated uric acid levels in the blood (hyperuricemia), leading to formation of urate crystals in joints. Acute gout attacks typically cause sudden, severe pain, redness, swelling, and tenderness in one joint (often the big toe), frequently starting at night. Attacks may be triggered by alcohol, red meat, seafood, or dehydration. Without treatment, gout can progress to chronic arthritis with joint damage and tophi (urate crystal deposits under skin). Risk factors include male gender, obesity, hypertension, kidney disease, certain medications, and family history. Diagnosis involves joint fluid analysis showing urate crystals, blood tests for uric acid (though levels may be normal during attacks), and sometimes imaging. Treatment for acute attacks includes NSAIDs, colchicine, or corticosteroids. Long-term management focuses on uric acid-lowering medications (like allopurinol or febuxostat), dietary changes (limiting alcohol, purine-rich foods), and maintaining healthy weight. Proper treatment can prevent recurrent attacks and joint damage."
Thrombocytopenia,"Thrombocytopenia is a condition characterized by abnormally low platelet count (<150,000/μL), increasing risk of bleeding or bruising. Causes include decreased platelet production (from bone marrow disorders, vitamin deficiencies), increased platelet destruction (immune thrombocytopenia, medications), or sequestration (enlarged spleen holding platelets). Symptoms may include easy bruising, prolonged bleeding from cuts, petechiae (tiny red spots on skin), nosebleeds, or in severe cases, internal bleeding. Diagnosis involves complete blood count, peripheral blood smear, and sometimes bone marrow biopsy to determine the cause. Treatment depends on severity and underlying cause: mild cases may require only monitoring; immune-mediated cases may need corticosteroids or IV immunoglobulin; severe bleeding may require platelet transfusions. For chronic immune thrombocytopenia, newer thrombopoietin receptor agonists can stimulate platelet production. Preventive measures include avoiding activities with high injury risk and medications that impair platelet function (like aspirin). Most cases can be managed effectively with proper treatment."
Hypoglycemia,"Hypoglycemia refers to abnormally low blood glucose levels (typically <70 mg/dL) that can cause various symptoms and potentially lead to unconsciousness if severe. It's most common in people with diabetes using insulin or certain oral medications but can also occur in non-diabetics from excessive alcohol, critical illnesses, hormone deficiencies, or insulin-producing tumors. Symptoms include shakiness, sweating, rapid heartbeat, hunger, confusion, irritability, dizziness, and in severe cases, seizures or loss of consciousness. The 'whipple's triad' confirms diagnosis: symptoms of hypoglycemia, low blood glucose at time of symptoms, and relief after glucose administration. Acute treatment involves consuming fast-acting carbohydrates (glucose tablets, juice). Severe cases may require glucagon injection or IV glucose. For recurrent hypoglycemia, treatment focuses on identifying and addressing the underlying cause, adjusting diabetes medications, and educating patients about symptom recognition. Preventive measures include regular meals/snacks, careful medication management, and blood glucose monitoring, especially before driving or operating machinery."
Aspiration Pneumonia,"Aspiration pneumonia occurs when food, liquid, saliva, or vomit is inhaled into the lungs, leading to inflammation and infection. It's particularly common in individuals with impaired swallowing (from stroke, dementia, Parkinson's), decreased consciousness (from alcohol, drugs), or gastroesophageal reflux. Symptoms may include cough (often with foul-smelling sputum), fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, and in severe cases, bluish skin from oxygen deprivation. Elderly patients may present with confusion rather than typical symptoms. Diagnosis involves physical exam, chest X-ray, and sometimes sputum cultures. Treatment requires antibiotics covering oral anaerobes and gram-negative bacteria, oxygen therapy if needed, and respiratory support in severe cases. Prevention focuses on proper positioning during feeding (upright for at least 30 minutes after meals), modifying food textures for those with swallowing difficulties, and good oral hygiene. Recurrent aspiration may require evaluation by a speech-language pathologist for swallowing therapy or long-term tube feeding in severe cases. Prognosis depends on the patient's overall health and promptness of treatment."
Colitis,"Colitis is inflammation of the colon (large intestine) that can have various causes including infections (C. difficile, E. coli, parasites), inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's), ischemic (reduced blood flow), or microscopic colitis. Symptoms typically include diarrhea (sometimes bloody), abdominal pain and cramping, urgency to defecate, and possibly fever in infectious cases. Chronic forms like ulcerative colitis may also cause weight loss and fatigue. Diagnosis involves stool tests for infections, blood tests, colonoscopy with biopsies, and sometimes imaging. Treatment depends on the cause: antibiotics for bacterial infections, anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive medications for IBD, or supportive care for viral cases. Severe ulcerative colitis may require hospitalization for IV steroids or surgery to remove the colon. Complications can include toxic megacolon, perforation, or increased cancer risk with chronic inflammation. Dietary modifications (low-residue during flares, adequate hydration) and stress management can help manage symptoms. Regular monitoring is important for chronic forms to detect complications early."
Diverticulosis,"Diverticulosis is a condition where small pouches (diverticula) form in weak spots of the colon wall, typically in the sigmoid colon. It becomes more common with age, affecting over half of people by age 80. Most individuals with diverticulosis have no symptoms, though some may experience mild abdominal discomfort, bloating, or changes in bowel habits. The condition is largely attributed to low-fiber diets causing increased pressure in the colon. Diagnosis is often made incidentally during colonoscopy or CT scans done for other reasons. While diverticulosis itself isn't harmful, complications can include diverticulitis (inflamed diverticula), bleeding, or perforation. Management focuses on high-fiber diet (fruits, vegetables, whole grains) to prevent complications, adequate hydration, and regular exercise. Contrary to past beliefs, nuts and seeds need not be avoided. Those with recurrent diverticulitis may require surgical removal of the affected colon segment. Routine screening isn't recommended for diverticulosis alone."
Suicide Attempt,"A suicide attempt is a self-inflicted, potentially injurious behavior with intent to die, regardless of whether it results in injury. Risk factors include mental health disorders (especially depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia), substance abuse, chronic pain or illness, previous suicide attempts, family history, and access to lethal means. Warning signs may include talking about wanting to die, feeling hopeless or trapped, increased substance use, withdrawing from activities, giving away possessions, or sudden mood improvement after depression. After an attempt, immediate medical care addresses any physical injuries, followed by comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to assess suicide risk and underlying mental health conditions. Treatment may involve hospitalization for safety, medications (antidepressants, mood stabilizers), psychotherapy (cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavior therapy), and development of a safety plan. Long-term management focuses on treating underlying conditions, developing coping skills, and establishing strong social support. Follow-up care is crucial as risk remains elevated after an attempt. Prevention involves limiting access to lethal means (firearms, medications) for at-risk individuals and promoting mental health awareness."
Pneumocystis Pneumonia,"Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a serious fungal infection of the lungs caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii, primarily affecting immunocompromised individuals, especially those with HIV/AIDS (when CD4 count <200), or others receiving immunosuppressive therapies. Symptoms develop over weeks and include progressive shortness of breath (especially with exertion), dry cough, fever, and chest tightness. Without treatment, it can lead to respiratory failure. Diagnosis involves chest X-ray (showing diffuse infiltrates), blood tests (elevated LDH), and microscopic examination of induced sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Treatment includes high-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for 21 days, with corticosteroids added for moderate-severe cases to reduce inflammation. Alternative medications are available for those allergic to sulfa drugs. Prophylaxis with TMP-SMX is recommended for high-risk patients until immune reconstitution (e.g., with HIV treatment). Prognosis has improved with early diagnosis and treatment, though mortality remains significant in severe cases. Prevention focuses on maintaining immune function and prophylactic medications for susceptible individuals."
Hepatitis B,"Hepatitis B is a serious liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) that can become chronic, leading to cirrhosis or liver cancer. The virus spreads through contact with infected blood or body fluids, including from mother to baby during birth, unprotected sex, sharing needles, or contaminated medical equipment. Many adults with acute infection have no symptoms, while some develop jaundice, fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, and joint pain. Chronic infection often causes no symptoms until liver damage is advanced. Diagnosis involves blood tests for HBV antigens and antibodies. Acute hepatitis B typically requires only supportive care, while chronic infection may be treated with antiviral medications (tenofovir, entecavir) to suppress viral replication. Vaccination provides effective prevention and is recommended for all infants and high-risk adults. Those with chronic HBV need regular monitoring for liver damage and cancer screening. While there's no cure for chronic hepatitis B, antiviral treatment can significantly reduce complications. Pregnant women with high viral loads may receive antivirals to prevent mother-to-child transmission."
Parkinson's Disease,"Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects movement due to loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra region of the brain. Classic motor symptoms include resting tremor (often starting in one hand), bradykinesia (slowness of movement), rigidity, and postural instability. Non-motor symptoms may precede motor symptoms by years and include loss of smell, REM sleep behavior disorder, constipation, depression, and cognitive changes. The exact cause is unknown but involves genetic and environmental factors. Diagnosis is clinical, based on symptoms and response to dopaminergic medications. Treatment focuses on symptom management with levodopa (most effective), dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors, and other medications. Deep brain stimulation may help advanced cases with motor fluctuations. Physical, occupational, and speech therapies are important adjuncts. While there's no cure, treatment can significantly improve quality of life for years. The disease progresses at variable rates, with later stages often complicated by dementia, severe mobility limitations, and swallowing difficulties requiring comprehensive care."
Lymphoma,"Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system, part of the body's immune network, that includes Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Symptoms may include painless swelling of lymph nodes (often in neck, armpit, or groin), fever, night sweats, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and itching. NHL is more common and has many subtypes with varying aggressiveness. Risk factors include weakened immune system, certain infections (Epstein-Barr virus, H. pylori), autoimmune diseases, and exposure to certain chemicals. Diagnosis involves lymph node biopsy, blood tests, imaging (CT/PET scans), and sometimes bone marrow biopsy. Treatment depends on type and stage but may include chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation, targeted therapy, or stem cell transplant. Hodgkin lymphoma has high cure rates even in advanced stages, while NHL prognosis varies widely by subtype. Newer treatments like CAR-T cell therapy show promise for refractory cases. Follow-up care monitors for recurrence and long-term treatment effects like secondary cancers or heart damage. Early detection improves outcomes for aggressive types."
Disease,Overview
Encephalopathy,"Encephalopathy refers to any diffuse disease of the brain that alters brain function or structure, causing mental status changes ranging from mild confusion to coma. Causes include metabolic disturbances (liver failure, kidney failure), infections, toxins (alcohol, drugs), hypoxia, trauma, or genetic disorders. Symptoms vary but commonly include confusion, memory loss, personality changes, poor concentration, lethargy, and in severe cases, seizures or coma. Hepatic encephalopathy from liver disease may cause a distinctive 'flapping tremor' (asterixis). Diagnosis involves identifying the underlying cause through blood tests, imaging (CT/MRI), EEG, and sometimes lumbar puncture. Treatment focuses on correcting the underlying disorder (e.g., ammonia-lowering treatments for hepatic encephalopathy, glucose for hypoglycemia, antibiotics for infections). Some forms are reversible with prompt treatment, while others (like chronic traumatic encephalopathy) cause progressive damage. Severe cases may require intensive care support. Preventive measures include managing chronic conditions and avoiding toxin exposure."
Tricuspid Valve Insufficiency,"Tricuspid valve insufficiency (or regurgitation) occurs when the tricuspid valve between the right atrium and ventricle doesn't close properly, allowing blood to flow backward. Causes include right ventricular dilation (from pulmonary hypertension), infective endocarditis (especially in IV drug users), rheumatic fever, or congenital defects. Symptoms develop gradually and may include fatigue, swelling in legs/abdomen, pulsating neck veins, and right upper quadrant discomfort from liver congestion. Severe cases can lead to right heart failure. Diagnosis involves physical exam (hearing a holosystolic murmur), echocardiogram, and sometimes cardiac MRI. Mild cases may require no treatment, while significant regurgitation is managed with diuretics for fluid retention and treatment of underlying causes (like pulmonary hypertension). Severe cases may need valve repair or replacement surgery. Prognosis depends on the severity and reversibility of the underlying condition. Patients with artificial valves need antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures to prevent endocarditis."
Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, characterized by progressive memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes due to brain cell degeneration. Pathological features include amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Early symptoms include difficulty remembering recent events or conversations, while later stages involve confusion, mood swings, language problems, and loss of bodily functions. Risk factors include age (most common after 65), family history, APOE-e4 gene variant, and cardiovascular disease risk factors. Diagnosis involves cognitive testing, neurological exams, and brain imaging to rule out other causes. While there's no cure, medications (cholinesterase inhibitors, memantine) can temporarily improve symptoms. Non-drug approaches include cognitive stimulation, routine establishment, and safety modifications at home. Research focuses on amyloid-targeting therapies. The disease progresses over 8-10 years on average, with late stages requiring full-time care. Support for caregivers is crucial due to the disease's emotional and physical demands."
Oral Candidiasis,"Oral candidiasis (thrush) is a fungal infection of the mouth caused by Candida albicans overgrowth, appearing as white patches on tongue/inner cheeks that can be scraped off, leaving red areas. Risk factors include antibiotic use (disrupting normal flora), inhaled corticosteroid use, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, dentures, and weakened immunity. Symptoms may include burning mouth pain, altered taste, and difficulty swallowing if the infection spreads. Diagnosis is usually clinical but may involve microscopic examination of scrapings. Treatment includes antifungal medications like nystatin swish-and-swallow or fluconazole tablets for 7-14 days. For denture wearers, soaking dentures in antifungal solution is important. Preventive measures include good oral hygiene, rinsing mouth after inhaled steroids, and controlling blood sugar in diabetics. Recurrent cases may indicate underlying immunodeficiency requiring further evaluation. Most cases resolve with treatment but can recur if predisposing factors persist."
Neuropathy,"Neuropathy refers to damage or dysfunction of one or more nerves, typically causing numbness, tingling, muscle weakness, and pain in affected areas. Peripheral neuropathy (affecting hands/feet) is most common and often caused by diabetes (diabetic neuropathy), but other causes include alcohol abuse, vitamin deficiencies (B12), infections (HIV, Lyme), autoimmune diseases, toxins, and hereditary conditions. Symptoms vary by nerve type affected: sensory (numbness/pain), motor (weakness), or autonomic (blood pressure/bladder issues). Diagnosis involves neurological exams, nerve conduction studies, blood tests for underlying causes, and sometimes nerve biopsy. Treatment focuses on managing the underlying condition, pain relief (with medications like gabapentin or duloxetine), and physical therapy to maintain strength. Diabetic patients need strict blood sugar control to prevent progression. Some neuropathies are reversible if caught early, while others cause permanent damage. Preventive measures include proper foot care for those with sensory loss to avoid unnoticed injuries."
Kidney Disease,"Kidney disease refers to any condition that impairs kidney function, ranging from mild impairment to complete kidney failure. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) develops over months to years, often from diabetes or hypertension, while acute kidney injury occurs suddenly from dehydration, medications, or obstruction. Symptoms may include fatigue, swelling, changes in urination, nausea, and confusion in advanced stages. Diagnosis involves blood tests (creatinine, BUN), urine tests (protein, sediment), and imaging (ultrasound). Treatment focuses on slowing progression through blood pressure control (often with ACE inhibitors), dietary modifications (protein, potassium, phosphorus restrictions), and managing complications like anemia or bone disease. End-stage kidney disease requires dialysis or transplantation. Preventive measures include controlling diabetes and hypertension, avoiding nephrotoxic medications, and staying hydrated. Regular monitoring is crucial as early stages often have no symptoms. CKD increases cardiovascular risk, requiring comprehensive care."
Fibroid Tumor,"Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas) are noncancerous growths of the uterus that often appear during childbearing years. These smooth muscle tumors vary in size from seedlings to large masses distorting the uterus. Many women have no symptoms, but others experience heavy menstrual bleeding, prolonged periods, pelvic pressure/pain, frequent urination, or reproductive difficulties. The exact cause is unknown but involves hormonal (estrogen-sensitive) and genetic factors. Diagnosis is typically through pelvic exam and ultrasound, sometimes MRI. Treatment depends on symptoms and may include pain relievers, iron supplements for anemia, hormonal medications (like GnRH agonists), or procedures (uterine artery embolization, myomectomy). Hysterectomy provides definitive treatment for severe cases. Fibroids often shrink after menopause. While not cancerous, they can significantly impact quality of life. Newer minimally invasive treatments like MRI-guided focused ultrasound offer alternatives to traditional surgery. Most fibroids don't affect fertility but location matters."
Glaucoma,"Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve, typically due to elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), leading to progressive vision loss. Open-angle glaucoma (most common) develops slowly with no early symptoms, while angle-closure glaucoma can cause sudden pain and vision loss. Risk factors include age >60, family history, African/Hispanic ancestry, and conditions like diabetes. Peripheral vision is lost first, creating 'tunnel vision.' Diagnosis involves tonometry (pressure measurement), optic nerve examination, visual field testing, and corneal thickness measurement. Treatment aims to lower IOP with eye drops (prostaglandins, beta-blockers), oral medications, laser therapy (trabeculoplasty), or surgery (trabeculectomy). While damage can't be reversed, early treatment can prevent further vision loss. Regular comprehensive eye exams are crucial since symptoms often appear only after significant damage occurs. Those with family history should start screening earlier. Normal-tension glaucoma occurs without high IOP, requiring different management."
Metastatic Neoplasm,"Metastatic cancer occurs when cancer cells spread from the primary site to distant organs through the bloodstream or lymphatic system. Common metastasis sites include bones, liver, lungs, and brain, depending on the original cancer (e.g., breast cancer often spreads to bones). Symptoms vary by location but may include pain, fractures (bone), jaundice (liver), headaches (brain), or shortness of breath (lungs). Diagnosis involves imaging (CT, PET, MRI), biopsies, and tests to identify the primary source. Treatment focuses on controlling growth and symptoms, often with systemic therapies like chemotherapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy, or targeted drugs. Local treatments (radiation, surgery) may relieve specific problems. While metastatic cancer is generally not curable, many types are treatable for years, especially breast, prostate, and some lymphomas. Palliative care is important for symptom management. Prognosis depends on cancer type, extent of spread, and response to treatment. New targeted therapies continue to improve outcomes."
Colon Carcinoma,"Colon cancer develops from malignant growths in the large intestine, usually beginning as benign polyps that transform over 10-15 years. Symptoms may include changes in bowel habits, rectal bleeding, abdominal discomfort, unexplained weight loss, or fatigue from anemia. Risk factors include age >50, family history, inflammatory bowel disease, low-fiber/high-fat diet, smoking, and sedentary lifestyle. Screening via colonoscopy (starting at age 45) can detect and remove precancerous polyps. Diagnosis involves colonoscopy with biopsy, imaging (CT colonography), and blood tests (CEA tumor marker). Treatment depends on stage but typically includes surgical resection, possibly with chemotherapy (for advanced cases) or radiation (for rectal cancer). Immunotherapy helps certain genetic subtypes. With early detection, 5-year survival exceeds 90%. Even metastatic disease has improved outcomes with newer targeted therapies. Preventive measures include regular screening, aspirin in high-risk individuals, maintaining healthy weight, and physical activity. Genetic testing is recommended for those with strong family history."
Diabetic Ketoacidosis,"Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication of diabetes (usually type 1) where severe insulin deficiency causes hyperglycemia, ketone production, and metabolic acidosis. Triggers include missed insulin doses, infection, or new-onset diabetes. Symptoms develop rapidly: excessive thirst, frequent urination, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, fruity breath odor, confusion, and potentially coma. Diagnosis shows high blood glucose (>250 mg/dL), ketones in blood/urine, and arterial pH <7.3. Emergency treatment requires IV fluids to correct dehydration, IV insulin to lower glucose/ketones, and electrolyte replacement (especially potassium). Bicarbonate is rarely needed. Monitoring includes frequent glucose/electrolyte checks to prevent cerebral edema during treatment. Prevention involves sick-day rules for diabetes management: never skipping insulin, checking glucose/ketones more often when ill, and maintaining hydration. DKA mortality is <5% with prompt treatment but higher in elderly or with severe comorbidities. Recurrent episodes may indicate psychosocial issues affecting diabetes care."
Tonic-Clonic Seizures,"Tonic-clonic seizures (formerly 'grand mal') are generalized seizures with two phases: tonic (muscle stiffening with loss of consciousness) followed by clonic (rhythmic jerking). These typically last 1-3 minutes and may be preceded by an aura. Postictally, patients experience confusion, fatigue, and often headache. Causes include epilepsy, brain injury, stroke, tumors, infections, or metabolic disturbances. First-time seizures require emergency evaluation to rule out acute causes (like hypoglycemia). Diagnosis involves EEG and brain imaging (MRI). Acute management focuses on preventing injury (cushioning head, turning on side) without restraining or putting objects in mouth. Status epilepticus (seizure >5 minutes or recurrent without recovery) requires emergency benzodiazepines. Long-term treatment includes antiepileptic drugs (valproate, levetiracetam), with consideration of epilepsy surgery for drug-resistant cases. Patients should avoid triggers like sleep deprivation and alcohol. Most achieve good control with medication, but driving restrictions apply until seizure-free for mandated periods (varies by location). Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a rare but serious risk."
Malignant Neoplasms,"Malignant neoplasms (cancers) are abnormal tissue growths that invade surrounding structures and metastasize to distant sites. Characteristics include uncontrolled proliferation, evasion of apoptosis, angiogenesis, and tissue invasion. Hundreds of types exist, classified by origin (carcinomas from epithelial cells, sarcomas from connective tissue, etc.). Symptoms vary widely but may include unexplained weight loss, fatigue, pain, skin changes, persistent cough, or unusual bleeding. Risk factors include genetic predisposition, environmental exposures (tobacco, radiation, chemicals), infections (HPV, H. pylori), and lifestyle factors (diet, alcohol). Diagnosis involves biopsy for histopathological examination, imaging (CT/PET/MRI), and molecular testing. Treatment modalities include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormone therapy, and targeted agents, often combined. Prognosis depends on cancer type, stage at diagnosis, and molecular features. Early detection through screening (mammography, colonoscopy) improves outcomes. Supportive care manages symptoms and treatment side effects. Cancer research continues to develop more precise and less toxic therapies, including personalized medicine approaches."
Respiratory Failure,"Respiratory failure occurs when the respiratory system fails in oxygenation (hypoxemic type I) or ventilation (hypercapnic type II), or both. Causes include pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, ARDS, drug overdose, or neuromuscular diseases. Symptoms include severe dyspnea, confusion, cyanosis, and in hypercapnia, headache and drowsiness. Diagnosis involves arterial blood gases (PaO2 <60 mmHg for hypoxemia, PaCO2 >50 mmHg for hypercapnia), chest imaging, and identifying the underlying cause. Acute respiratory failure is a medical emergency requiring oxygen therapy, possibly non-invasive ventilation (BiPAP) or mechanical intubation. Treatment targets the underlying condition: antibiotics for infection, bronchodilators for COPD, diuretics for heart failure. Chronic respiratory failure may require long-term oxygen therapy. Complications include multi-organ failure and cardiac arrest. Prognosis depends on the underlying cause and patient's overall health. Preventive measures include smoking cessation, vaccination (pneumonia/flu), and proper management of chronic lung diseases. Rehabilitation improves outcomes in chronic cases."
Melanoma,"Melanoma is the most serious type of skin cancer that develops in melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells. While less common than basal or squamous cell carcinomas, it's more likely to spread if not caught early. Warning signs follow the ABCDE rule: Asymmetry, irregular Borders, Color variation, Diameter >6mm, and Evolution (changing). Risk factors include UV exposure (sunlight/tanning beds), fair skin, numerous moles, family history, and immunosuppression. Diagnosis involves full-body skin examination and biopsy of suspicious lesions. Staging determines thickness (Breslow depth), ulceration, and spread (to lymph nodes/organs). Early-stage treatment is surgical excision with margins. Advanced cases may require sentinel lymph node biopsy, immunotherapy (checkpoint inhibitors), targeted therapy (for BRAF mutations), radiation, or chemotherapy. Five-year survival exceeds 98% for localized disease but drops with metastasis. Prevention focuses on UV protection (sunscreen, clothing), avoiding tanning beds, and regular skin self-exams. Those at high risk need professional skin checks annually."
Gastroenteritis,"Gastroenteritis is inflammation of the stomach and intestines typically caused by viral (norovirus, rotavirus), bacterial (E. coli, Salmonella), or parasitic infections. Symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and sometimes fever. Transmission occurs through contaminated food/water, person-to-person contact, or poor hygiene. Most cases are self-limiting (1-3 days), but severe dehydration can occur, especially in infants and elderly. Diagnosis is usually clinical; testing is reserved for severe/persistent cases. Treatment focuses on rehydration with oral rehydration solutions or IV fluids for severe cases. Antiemetics may help vomiting, but antidiarrheals are often avoided in infectious cases. Antibiotics are rarely needed except for specific bacterial causes. Prevention includes handwashing, proper food handling, and rotavirus vaccination for infants. Traveler's diarrhea can be prevented by avoiding tap water/uncooked foods in high-risk areas. Most people recover completely, though some bacterial infections (like C. difficile) can cause post-infectious complications."
Lung Carcinoma,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, primarily caused by smoking but also occurring in non-smokers. Types include non-small cell (NSCLC - 85%, with subtypes adenocarcinoma, squamous, large cell) and small cell (SCLC - more aggressive). Symptoms often appear late and may include persistent cough, hemoptysis (coughing blood), chest pain, weight loss, and recurrent pneumonia. Risk factors include smoking (primary), secondhand smoke, radon, asbestos, and air pollution. Screening with low-dose CT is recommended for high-risk smokers. Diagnosis involves imaging (CT/PET), bronchoscopy/biopsy, and molecular testing (for EGFR, ALK, etc. in NSCLC). Treatment varies: early-stage NSCLC is treated surgically with possible adjuvant therapy; locally advanced cases need chemoradiation; metastatic disease receives targeted therapy/immunotherapy based on biomarkers. SCLC responds initially to chemo/radiation but often recurs. Prognosis depends heavily on stage at diagnosis, with 5-year survival ranging from 60% for localized to 6% for metastatic disease. Smoking cessation at any stage improves outcomes."
Manic Disorder,"Manic episodes are periods of abnormally elevated mood, energy, and activity that are hallmark features of bipolar I disorder. Symptoms include euphoria or irritability, decreased need for sleep, rapid speech, racing thoughts, grandiosity, reckless behavior (spending sprees, risky sex), and poor judgment. Episodes last at least one week (or any duration if hospitalization is needed) and cause significant impairment. Psychotic features (delusions/hallucinations) may occur. Differential diagnosis includes substance-induced mania or medical causes (hyperthyroidism). Treatment involves mood stabilizers (lithium, valproate), antipsychotics, and sometimes benzodiazepines for acute agitation. Long-term management focuses on medication adherence, psychotherapy (CBT, psychoeducation), and lifestyle regularity (sleep schedule). Hospitalization may be needed to prevent harm during severe episodes. Without treatment, manic episodes typically resolve in weeks to months but can damage relationships, finances, and careers. Recurrence is likely without maintenance treatment. Family support is crucial in recognizing early warning signs of recurrence."
Personality Disorder,"Personality disorders are enduring patterns of inner experience and behavior that deviate from cultural expectations, leading to distress or impairment. They're grouped into clusters: A (odd/eccentric - paranoid, schizoid, schizotypal), B (dramatic/erratic - antisocial, borderline, histrionic, narcissistic), and C (anxious/fearful - avoidant, dependent, obsessive-compulsive). Borderline personality disorder features emotional instability, fear of abandonment, self-harm, and unstable relationships. Antisocial personality disorder involves disregard for others' rights, deceitfulness, and lack of remorse. Diagnosis requires long-standing patterns apparent by early adulthood. Treatment is challenging but may include dialectical behavior therapy (especially for BPD), cognitive therapy, and sometimes medications for specific symptoms (e.g., mood stabilizers for emotional dysregulation). Prognosis varies; some improve with age while others persist. Comorbidity with mood/anxiety disorders and substance abuse is common. Therapeutic alliance is crucial but may be difficult to establish. Early intervention for emerging traits in adolescence shows promise."
Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer, usually developing in the setting of chronic liver disease/cirrhosis from hepatitis B/C, alcohol, or NAFLD. Symptoms often appear late and may include right upper quadrant pain, weight loss, jaundice, or worsening ascites in cirrhotic patients. Surveillance with ultrasound and AFP every 6 months is recommended for high-risk patients. Diagnosis can often be made radiologically (CT/MRI showing arterial enhancement/washout) without biopsy in cirrhotics. Staging considers tumor size/number, vascular invasion, and liver function (Child-Pugh score). Treatment options include surgical resection (for early-stage with preserved function), liver transplant (Milan criteria), ablation (radiofrequency/microwave), embolization (TACE), targeted therapy (sorafenib, lenvatinib), or immunotherapy. Prevention focuses on controlling risk factors: antiviral treatment for hepatitis B/C, alcohol cessation, and managing metabolic syndrome. Prognosis depends on stage at diagnosis, with 5-year survival >70% for early-stage but <5% for metastatic disease. Multidisciplinary care is essential."
Pulmonary Emphysema,"Pulmonary emphysema, a type of COPD, involves destruction of alveoli walls, reducing lung elasticity and causing air trapping. Primarily caused by smoking, it leads to progressive shortness of breath (initially with exertion) and often a barrel-chested appearance. Other symptoms may include chronic cough, wheezing, and weight loss in advanced cases. Diagnosis involves spirometry showing irreversible airflow obstruction (FEV1/FVC <0.7), chest imaging (hyperinflation, flattened diaphragms), and sometimes alpha-1 antitrypsin testing in young patients/non-smokers. Management includes smoking cessation (most crucial intervention), bronchodilators (LAMA/LABA), pulmonary rehabilitation, and oxygen for chronic hypoxemia. Vaccinations (pneumococcal, influenza) prevent exacerbations. Severe cases may benefit from lung volume reduction surgery or transplantation. Acute exacerbations (increased dyspnea/sputum) often require steroids and antibiotics. Prognosis varies; the BODE index (BMI, obstruction, dyspnea, exercise capacity) helps predict mortality. While damage is irreversible, progression can be slowed with proper management. Palliative care becomes important in advanced stages."
Hemorrhoids,"Hemorrhoids are swollen veins in the lower rectum and anus that can be internal (above dentate line) or external. Contributing factors include straining during bowel movements, chronic constipation/diarrhea, pregnancy, and prolonged sitting. Symptoms include rectal pain/itching, bright red blood on toilet paper, and possibly a protruding lump (prolapsed hemorrhoid). Diagnosis is by visual inspection and digital rectal exam (unless severe pain precludes), sometimes anoscopy. Most cases are managed conservatively with high-fiber diet, increased fluids, stool softeners, and topical treatments (hydrocortisone, witch hazel). Warm sitz baths provide symptom relief. Procedures like rubber band ligation or sclerotherapy may be needed for persistent internal hemorrhoids. Surgical hemorrhoidectomy is reserved for severe/prolapsed cases. Thrombosed external hemorrhoids (painful bluish lumps) may require incision for clot evacuation if seen early. Prevention focuses on avoiding constipation and straining. While common and often recurrent, hemorrhoids rarely lead to serious complications like anemia from chronic bleeding."
Bronchial Spasm,"Bronchial spasm refers to sudden constriction of the muscles in bronchial walls, narrowing airways and causing breathing difficulty. It's characteristic of asthma but can also occur with allergies, respiratory infections, COPD, or irritant exposure. Symptoms include wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing. Severe spasms can lead to respiratory distress with use of accessory muscles and hypoxia. Diagnosis involves clinical assessment, pulmonary function tests (showing reversible obstruction), and sometimes challenge tests. Acute treatment uses short-acting bronchodilators (albuterol) via inhaler or nebulizer. Severe attacks may require systemic corticosteroids and oxygen. Preventive management includes identifying/avoiding triggers, long-term control medications (inhaled corticosteroids, LABA), and leukotriene modifiers. Allergic causes may benefit from antihistamines or immunotherapy. An asthma action plan helps patients manage worsening symptoms. Status asthmaticus (unresponsive severe attack) is a medical emergency requiring intensive care. Proper long-term control reduces exacerbation risk and prevents airway remodeling."
Aphasia,"Aphasia is an acquired language disorder affecting speech production/comprehension, reading, or writing, typically caused by left hemisphere brain damage (stroke most common). Broca's (expressive) aphasia involves non-fluent, effortful speech with relatively preserved comprehension. Wernicke's (receptive) aphasia features fluent but nonsensical speech with poor comprehension. Global aphasia impairs all language modalities. Diagnosis involves language testing (naming, repetition, comprehension) and neuroimaging (CT/MRI) to identify the lesion. Treatment primarily involves speech-language therapy tailored to the aphasia type and severity. Melodic intonation therapy helps some non-fluent cases. Recovery depends on lesion size/location, age, and rehabilitation intensity; most improvement occurs in first 6 months but can continue for years. Alternative communication methods (writing, gestures, apps) help during recovery. Family education is crucial as frustration is common. While aphasia doesn't affect intelligence, it significantly impacts quality of life and often requires psychosocial support. Prevention focuses on stroke risk reduction."
Morbid Obesity,"Morbid obesity (class III obesity) is defined as BMI ≥40 or ≥35 with obesity-related comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, sleep apnea). It results from complex interactions between genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors. Health risks include cardiovascular disease, osteoarthritis, certain cancers, and reduced life expectancy. Evaluation assesses for underlying endocrine causes and comorbidities. Treatment begins with intensive lifestyle intervention (diet, exercise, behavior modification), though long-term weight loss is difficult to maintain. FDA-approved anti-obesity medications (like semaglutide) may aid weight loss when combined with lifestyle changes. Bariatric surgery (gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy) is the most effective treatment for sustained weight loss and comorbidity resolution, indicated for BMI ≥40 or ≥35 with comorbidities. Post-surgical care includes nutritional monitoring (for deficiencies) and long-term follow-up. Multidisciplinary programs address physical and psychological aspects. While challenging to treat, even modest weight loss (5-10%) significantly improves metabolic health. Public health measures focus on obesity prevention through healthier environments."
Pyelonephritis,"Pyelonephritis is a kidney infection typically ascending from the bladder, most often caused by gram-negative bacteria (E. coli). Symptoms include fever, flank pain, nausea/vomiting, and sometimes urinary symptoms (frequency, urgency). Complicated cases (pregnancy, obstruction, diabetes, or recurrent infections) may lead to abscesses or sepsis. Diagnosis involves urinalysis (WBCs, bacteria), urine culture, and sometimes imaging (CT for suspected obstruction/abscess). Uncomplicated cases in non-pregnant women can be treated with oral antibiotics (fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins) for 7-14 days. Severe/complicated cases require hospitalization for IV antibiotics (like ceftriaxone or piperacillin-tazobactam) and fluid resuscitation. Follow-up cultures ensure eradication. Prevention of recurrence includes identifying/correcting anatomical abnormalities, prophylactic antibiotics for frequent infections, and proper hydration. Chronic pyelonephritis from recurrent infections can lead to kidney scarring and hypertension. Pregnant women require prompt treatment as pyelonephritis can trigger preterm labor."
Endocarditis,"Endocarditis is infection of the heart valves (native or prosthetic) or endocardial surface, typically caused by bacteria (staphylococci, streptococci) entering the bloodstream. Risk factors include valve disease, IV drug use, prosthetic valves, and recent dental procedures. Symptoms may develop acutely (high fever, toxicity) or subacutely (weeks of fever, fatigue, weight loss). Classic findings include new heart murmur, petechiae, splinter hemorrhages, Osler's nodes (tender finger nodules), and Janeway lesions (painless palm/sole spots). Complications include valve destruction leading to heart failure, embolic strokes, and abscesses. Diagnosis requires blood cultures and echocardiography (TTE or TEE). Treatment involves prolonged IV antibiotics (4-6 weeks), sometimes valve surgery for severe regurgitation, abscess, or recurrent emboli. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for high-risk patients before dental procedures. IV drug users face particular challenges with treatment adherence and recurrent infections. Mortality remains significant (20-30%) despite treatment, emphasizing early recognition in at-risk patients with unexplained fever."
Pericardial Effusion,"Pericardial effusion is fluid accumulation in the pericardial sac surrounding the heart. Causes include viral pericarditis, malignancy (lung cancer, breast cancer), uremia, trauma, or autoimmune diseases. Small effusions may be asymptomatic, while larger ones cause dyspnea, chest pressure, or symptoms from cardiac tamponade (life-threatening compression of the heart). Tamponade presents with Beck's triad: hypotension, jugular venous distension, and muffled heart sounds. Diagnosis involves echocardiography (showing fluid and possibly diastolic right ventricular collapse), ECG (low voltage, electrical alternans), and sometimes pericardiocentesis for analysis. Treatment depends on size and hemodynamic impact: small asymptomatic effusions may only require monitoring, while symptomatic ones need drainage (percutaneous or surgical). Tamponade is a medical emergency requiring immediate pericardiocentesis. Recurrent effusions may need pericardial window creation. The underlying cause must be treated (e.g., chemotherapy for malignancy, dialysis for uremia). Prognosis depends on the etiology, with malignant effusions having poorer outcomes."
Chronic Alcoholism,"Chronic alcoholism (alcohol use disorder) involves compulsive alcohol use despite negative consequences, with physiological dependence (tolerance and withdrawal). Complications include liver disease (cirrhosis), pancreatitis, cardiomyopathy, neuropathy, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (thiamine deficiency), and increased cancer risk. Diagnosis assesses consumption patterns (standard drinks per day), failed attempts to cut down, and alcohol-related problems (health, work, legal). Treatment begins with medically supervised detoxification (using benzodiazepines to prevent withdrawal seizures/DTs), followed by rehabilitation programs combining psychotherapy (CBT, motivational interviewing), medications (naltrexone, acamprosate, disulfiram), and support groups (AA). Relapse is common and doesn't indicate treatment failure. Long-term management addresses co-occurring mental health disorders and social determinants. Abstinence improves most complications, though some (like cirrhosis) may progress. Family involvement is often crucial. Public health measures (alcohol taxes, advertising restrictions) aim to reduce harm at population levels. Even late-stage patients can benefit from treatment."
Pneumothorax,"Pneumothorax is air in the pleural space causing lung collapse, classified as spontaneous (primary without lung disease or secondary to COPD/cystic fibrosis) or traumatic. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax typically occurs in tall, thin young males and may recur. Symptoms include sudden pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea; tension pneumothorax (mediastinal shift compromising venous return) is life-threatening with hypotension and requires immediate needle decompression. Diagnosis is by reduced breath sounds on exam and chest X-ray (showing visceral pleural line) or CT. Small primary pneumothoraces (<2cm) may resolve with observation, while larger ones require aspiration or chest tube drainage. Secondary pneumothoraces often need prolonged chest drainage and treatment of underlying lung disease. Recurrent cases may require pleurodesis (chemical or surgical) to adhere lung to chest wall. Prevention involves smoking cessation (major risk factor for primary) and proper management of underlying lung conditions. Most patients recover fully, but recurrence rates approach 50% without preventive measures."
Delirium,"Delirium is an acute decline in attention and cognition fluctuating over hours to days, often with altered consciousness. Hyperactive delirium presents with agitation/hallucinations; hypoactive with lethargy (often missed). Causes are multifactorial: infections, medications, metabolic derangements, withdrawal, or CNS pathology. Hospitalized elderly are particularly vulnerable. Diagnosis relies on clinical assessment (CAM tool) after excluding dementia. Workup includes review of medications, infections screen, metabolic tests, and sometimes neuroimaging. Treatment focuses on identifying/treating underlying causes while providing supportive care: reorientation strategies, sleep hygiene, and avoiding physical restraints. Low-dose antipsychotics may be needed short-term for severe agitation. Prevention involves minimizing risk factors: ensuring hydration, sleep, mobility, and sensory aids (glasses/hearing aids). Delirium prolongs hospital stays and increases mortality risk; up to 40% of cases progress to long-term cognitive impairment. Family education is crucial as delirium often frightens patients and caregivers. Multicomponent hospital protocols reduce incidence."
Neutropenia,"Neutropenia is an abnormally low neutrophil count (<1500/μL), increasing infection risk. Causes include chemotherapy (most common), autoimmune diseases, viral infections, medications, or bone marrow disorders. Fever in neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <500) is an oncologic emergency requiring immediate broad-spectrum IV antibiotics after cultures. Symptoms may be muted without sufficient inflammatory response. Diagnosis involves CBC with differential, peripheral smear, and sometimes bone marrow biopsy. Treatment depends on cause and severity: chemotherapy-induced neutropenia may need granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to stimulate production; autoimmune cases may respond to corticosteroids. Febrile neutropenia requires hospitalization for IV antibiotics covering Pseudomonas (like cefepime). Preventive measures include hand hygiene, avoiding raw foods, and prophylactic antibiotics/antifungals in high-risk patients. Recovery time varies: chemotherapy-induced neutropenia typically resolves in 2-3 weeks, while chronic forms require long-term management. Prognosis depends on underlying condition; persistent severe neutropenia (<500) carries high mortality from opportunistic infections."
Hyperbilirubinemia,"Hyperbilirubinemia refers to elevated bilirubin levels in blood, causing jaundice (yellowing of skin/sclera). Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia results from increased production (hemolysis) or impaired hepatic uptake/conjugation (Gilbert's syndrome, neonatal jaundice). Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia indicates hepatobiliary disease (hepatitis, cirrhosis, biliary obstruction). Symptoms vary by cause but may include pruritus (with cholestasis), dark urine, and pale stools (obstructive pattern). Diagnosis involves fractionated bilirubin, liver enzymes, CBC for hemolysis, and imaging (ultrasound for biliary dilation). Neonatal jaundice is common and usually physiologic but requires phototherapy if levels approach thresholds for kernicterus (bilirubin encephalopathy). Adult treatment targets the underlying condition: ursodeoxycholic acid for some cholestatic disorders, ERCP for obstructions, or immunosuppressants for autoimmune hepatitis. Gilbert's syndrome requires no treatment. Chronic hyperbilirubinemia from inherited disorders (Crigler-Najjar) may need phenobarbital or liver transplant. Prognosis depends on etiology, with obstructive causes having better outcomes if relieved promptly."
Influenza,"Influenza is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses (types A, B), with seasonal epidemics typically peaking in winter. Symptoms include abrupt onset of fever, myalgia, headache, fatigue, cough, and sore throat. Complications can include pneumonia (viral or bacterial), myositis, or exacerbation of chronic conditions. High-risk groups (elderly, young children, pregnant women, chronically ill) are more likely to develop severe disease. Diagnosis is often clinical but may involve rapid antigen tests or PCR during outbreaks. Treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir) is most effective when started within 48 hours of symptoms, especially for high-risk patients. Annual vaccination is the primary prevention strategy, with formulations updated yearly for circulating strains. Infection control measures (hand hygiene, masking, staying home when ill) limit spread. Most healthy adults recover in 1-2 weeks, but fatigue may persist. Antiviral chemoprophylaxis is considered for unvaccinated high-risk contacts during outbreaks. Pandemic influenza occurs when novel strains emerge (like 2009 H1N1), requiring enhanced public health responses."
Substance Dependence,"Substance dependence involves compulsive drug use despite harm, with physiological dependence (tolerance and withdrawal) and psychological craving. Commonly abused substances include alcohol, opioids, stimulants, and sedatives. Dependence develops through neuroadaptations in reward pathways (dopamine, glutamate systems). Symptoms include inability to cut down use, spending excessive time obtaining/using the substance, and continued use despite physical/mental health problems. Diagnosis follows DSM-5 criteria assessing impaired control, social impairment, risky use, and pharmacological criteria. Treatment begins with medically supervised detoxification when needed (especially for alcohol/benzodiazepines to prevent life-threatening withdrawal), followed by rehabilitation combining behavioral therapies (CBT, contingency management) and medications (methadone/buprenorphine for opioids, naltrexone for alcohol). Relapse is common and doesn't indicate treatment failure; long-term management is essential. Support groups (AA, NA) provide peer support. Co-occurring mental health disorders must be treated concurrently. Harm reduction strategies (needle exchanges, naloxone distribution) save lives. Recovery is a lifelong process requiring comprehensive support systems."
Thrombus,"A thrombus is a blood clot that forms inside a blood vessel or heart chamber. Arterial thrombi (rich in platelets) typically form at sites of atherosclerosis rupture, causing acute ischemia (myocardial infarction, stroke). Venous thrombi (rich in fibrin/red cells) often form in slow-flowing veins (DVT), risking pulmonary embolism. Risk factors include immobility, surgery, trauma, cancer, pregnancy, and inherited hypercoagulable states (Factor V Leiden). Symptoms depend on location: DVT causes limb swelling/pain; PE causes sudden dyspnea/chest pain. Diagnosis involves imaging (ultrasound for DVT, CT for PE) and sometimes D-dimer testing. Acute treatment uses anticoagulants (heparins, DOACs) to prevent extension; thrombolytics may be used for massive PE or arterial clots. Chronic management focuses on preventing recurrence with oral anticoagulation (3-6 months minimum, sometimes lifelong). Compression stockings prevent post-thrombotic syndrome after DVT. Prophylaxis with anticoagulants or mechanical compression is crucial for high-risk hospitalized patients. Prognosis depends on timely treatment and underlying risk factors."
Cholecystitis,"Cholecystitis is the inflammation of the gallbladder, often caused by gallstones blocking the bile duct. It typically presents with severe pain in the upper right abdomen, fever, and nausea. If untreated, it can lead to serious complications like gallbladder rupture or infection. Diagnosis is confirmed via ultrasound or CT scan, and treatment may involve antibiotics and surgical removal of the gallbladder."
Hernia Hiatal,"A hiatal hernia occurs when part of the stomach bulges through the diaphragm into the chest cavity. It often leads to symptoms like heartburn, acid reflux, and chest pain. Larger hernias may cause difficulty swallowing or breathing problems. Diagnosis is typically done with imaging or endoscopy. Treatment includes lifestyle changes, medications, and in severe cases, surgery."
Migraine Disorders,"Migraine is a neurological disorder characterized by intense, throbbing headaches, often accompanied by nausea, sensitivity to light and sound, and visual disturbances. Migraine attacks can last from hours to days and may be triggered by stress, certain foods, hormonal changes, or lack of sleep. Treatment involves pain relievers, preventive medications, and lifestyle adjustments. Chronic migraines require long-term management under medical supervision."
Pancytopenia,"Pancytopenia is a medical condition where there is a reduction in all three types of blood cells: red cells, white cells, and platelets. It can result from bone marrow failure, autoimmune diseases, or exposure to certain toxins or medications. Symptoms may include fatigue, frequent infections, and easy bruising or bleeding. Diagnosis involves blood tests and bone marrow biopsy, and treatment targets the underlying cause."
Biliary Calculus,"Biliary calculus, also known as gallstones, are hardened deposits that form in the gallbladder. These stones can block bile flow, causing pain, nausea, vomiting, or even inflammation (cholecystitis). Risk factors include obesity, pregnancy, rapid weight loss, and certain diets. Gallstones are often diagnosed with ultrasound, and treatment ranges from dietary management to gallbladder removal."
Tachycardia Sinus,"Sinus tachycardia refers to a faster-than-normal heart rate that originates from the heart's natural pacemaker (sinus node). It is usually a physiological response to stress, exercise, fever, or anxiety, but may also occur due to underlying conditions like anemia or hyperthyroidism. Symptoms can include palpitations, shortness of breath, or dizziness. Treatment focuses on addressing the root cause."
Ileus,"Ileus is a temporary and often painful cessation of bowel motility, leading to intestinal obstruction. It commonly occurs after abdominal surgery, infection, or use of certain medications. Symptoms include abdominal bloating, pain, vomiting, and absence of bowel movements. Diagnosis is made via imaging, and treatment includes bowel rest, nasogastric suction, and supportive care."
Adhesion,"Adhesions are bands of scar tissue that form between internal organs and tissues, often after surgery or inflammation. They can cause organs to stick together, leading to pain, bowel obstruction, or infertility. Most adhesions are asymptomatic, but problematic ones may require surgical intervention. Prevention includes minimally invasive surgical techniques and careful post-operative care."
Delusion,"A delusion is a strongly held false belief that persists despite clear evidence to the contrary. It is a hallmark symptom of psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia and can also appear in mood disorders with psychotic features. Types of delusions include paranoid, grandiose, or somatic. Treatment typically involves antipsychotic medications and cognitive behavioral therapy."
Affect Labile,Labile affect refers to rapid and exaggerated changes in mood or emotional expression. It is often observed in neurological conditions like pseudobulbar affect or psychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder. These sudden mood shifts are not always congruent with external circumstances. Management includes addressing the underlying cause and using mood-stabilizing or antipsychotic medications.
Decubitus Ulcer,"Also known as pressure sores or bedsores, decubitus ulcers are injuries to skin and underlying tissue caused by prolonged pressure. Commonly found on bony areas like the hips or heels, they affect individuals with limited mobility. Risk factors include immobility, incontinence, and poor nutrition. Prevention involves regular repositioning, skin care, and adequate hydration. Advanced ulcers may require surgical treatment."
Hypoglycemia,"Hypoglycemia refers to abnormally low blood sugar levels, typically below 70 mg/dL. It often affects people with diabetes taking insulin or certain oral medications. Symptoms include shakiness, sweating, confusion, irritability, and in severe cases, loss of consciousness. Immediate treatment involves consuming fast-acting carbohydrates. Long-term management includes medication adjustments and regular blood glucose monitoring."
Hemiparesis,"Hemiparesis is the weakness or partial paralysis affecting one side of the body, usually resulting from stroke, brain injury, or neurological disorders. It may impact the arm, leg, and facial muscles on the same side. Rehabilitation focuses on physical therapy, occupational therapy, and sometimes speech therapy. Recovery depends on the underlying cause and the timing of intervention."
